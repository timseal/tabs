Verse 1:

	(Ab/Bb)   Eb               Ab/Bb
	  So you think the girl is crazy
	Eb   Gm7-5/Db       C7             Fm

	Bb                                          Eb
	She's just tryin' to do what her heart says to
	To love you

	Ab                     Eb/G
	And as you take to the wind
	                      (to the wind again she breaks down)
	Ab                        Db9
	And as she breaks down within (within, within)

Pre-chorus:

	Eb/Bb
	She waits for you patiently
	Ab/Bb
	Hopin' that someday you'll see
	         Eb/Bb
	[2: That] all she really wants to be
	   Ab/Bb                   Gm    Ab
	Is yours and yours alone, eternally

Chorus:

	(Ab)         Gm       Fm     Eb
	What do you want the girl to do
	     Ab                     Gm           Fm      Eb
	[1: Don't you know] you're breakin' the child in two
	[2: Can't you see]
	 Ab          Gm       Fm     Eb
	What do you want the girl to do
	Ab [N.C.]                G   Cm  G7/B  Cm     Ab/Bb
	All she really wants is you

Verse 2:

	She knows what you are
	Still she'll be your queen if you let her
	(Just say the word today)
	(Build the world around her)

	Now and then you'll promise
	All the way-out things you're goin' to get her
	(You will see, you will see)
	                  'Cause maybe she knows better
	(You're so damn glad you found her, found her, years ago)

	As she watched you come and go (all you'll show)
	And as she watched your promises erode

[repeat pre-chorus]

[repeat chorus]

	What do you want the girl to do
	 Ab                    Gm           Fm      Eb
	Don't you know you're breakin' the child in two
	 Ab         Gm       Fm     Eb
	What do you want the girl to do
	 Ab                   Gm           Fm      Eb
	Can't you see you're breakin' the child in two [fade]

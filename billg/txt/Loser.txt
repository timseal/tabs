   Loser

   Am G C D

   If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn

   C Em Am

   I could arm a town the size of Abiliene.

   Am C-G Em D

   Don't you push me baby because I'm moanin' low,

   C Em Am Em Am

   You know I'm only in it for the gold.

   Am G C D

   All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars,

   Am7 C Em Am

   and I could pay you back with one good hand.

   Am C G Em D

   You can look around about the wide world over,

   C Em Am Em Am

   and you'll never find another honest man.

   chorus:

   G D A

   Last fair deal in the country (sweet suzy),

   G D A

   Last fair deal in the town.

   G D A

   Put your gold money where your love is baby,

   C G Am Em D (C Am?)

   Before you let my deal go down, go down.

   Am C-G Em D

   Don't you push me baby because I'm moanin' low,

   C Em Am

   Cause I know a little something you won't ever know.

   Am C-G Em D

   Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee,

   C Em Am Em Am

   Gonna get up in the morning and go.

   Am G C D

   Everybody's braggin' and drinkin that wine,

   Am7 Em Am

   I can tell the queen of diamonds by the way she shines.

   Am C-G Em D

   Come to daddy on an inside straight,

   C Em Am Em Am

   Cause I got no chance of losing this time,

   C Em Am Em Am

   Cause I got no chance of losing this time,

   C G Am Em D (C Am?)

   Cause I got no chance of losing this time....

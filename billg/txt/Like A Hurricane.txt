   #Unplugged

   [Am] [G] [F] [Em]

   [Am]Once I thought I saw you in a [G]crowded, hazy bar,

   [F]Dancing on the light from star to [Em]star. [G]

   [Am]Far across the moon beams, I [G]know that's who you are.

   I [F]saw your brown eyes turning once to [Em]fire. [G]

   [C]You [G]are [F]like a [G]hurricane: [C]there's [G]calm [F]in your
   [G]eye.

   [C]And [G]I'm [F]getting [G]blown away.

   [F]There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay.

   I wanna love you but I'm getting blown a[Am]way. [G] [F] [Em] [G]

   [Am]I am just a dreamer, but [G]you are just a dream,

   And [F] you could have been anyone to [Em]me.[G]

   [Am]Before that moment you touched my lips, that

   [G]Perfect feeling when time just slips

   A[F]way between us and our foggy [Em]trips.[G]

   [C]You [G]are [F]like a [G]hurricane: [C]there's [G]calm [F]in your
   [G]eye.

   [C]And [G]I'm [F]getting [G]blown away.

   [F]There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay.

   I wanna love you but I'm getting blown a[Am]way. [G] [F] [Em] [G]

   [C]You [G]are [F]like a [G]hurricane: [C]there's [G]calm [F]in your
   [G]eye.

   [C]And [G]I'm [F]getting [G]blown away.

   [F]There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay.

   I wanna love you but I'm getting blown a[Am]way. [G] [F] [Em] [G]

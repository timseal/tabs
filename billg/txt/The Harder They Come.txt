   The Harder They Come-Jimmy Cliff

   G

   They tell me of a pie up in the sky

   F

   Waiting for me when I die

   G

   But between the day you're born, and when you die

   F

   They never seem to hear even your cry

   Em

   But, as sure as the sun will shine

   Am

   I'm gonna get my share of what's mine

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   The oppressors are trying to keep me down

   Trying to drive me underground

   And though they think they've got the battle won

   I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done

   Em

   But, as sure as the sun will shine

   Am

   I'm gonna get my share of what's mine

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   SOLO OVER VERSE AND CHORUS

   And I'll keep on fighting for the things I want

   Though I know that when you're dead you can't

   But I'd rather be a free man in my grave

   Than living as a puppet or a slave

   Em

   But, as sure as the sun will shine

   Am

   I'm gonna get my share of what's mine

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   G F C

   And the harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

   I Wish it Would Rain
   The Temptations
   ________

   Sunshine, blue skies, please go away

   My girl has found another and gone away

   With her with my future, my life is filled with gloom

   So day after day, I stay locked up in my room

   I know to you it might sound strange

   But I wish it would rain

   (Oh how I wish that it would rain)

   'Cause so badly I wanna go outside (such a lovely day)

   But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry

   I gotta cry 'cause cryin' is such a pain, oh yeah -WRONG-

   I gotta cry 'cause cryin' eases the pain, oh yeah -RIGHT-

   People, this hurt I feel inside words can never explain

   I just wish it would rain

   (Oh how I wish that it would rain)

   Rain, rain, rain

   (Oh how I wish that it would rain)

   (instrumental)

   Day in, day out, my tear-stained face is pressed against

   the window pane

   I search the skies desperately for rain

   'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops

   And no one will ever know

   That I'm cryin', cryin' when I go outside

   To the world outside, my tears I refuse to explain

   Oh, I wish it would rain

   (Oh how I wish that it would rain)

   Let it rain, let it rain

   I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes...

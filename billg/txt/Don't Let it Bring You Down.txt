   Don't Let It Bring You Down :

   After The Goldrush : Neil Young

   Intro:

   A G A C (x2)

   A

   Old man lying by the side of the road

   Am7

   With the lorries rolling by

   D

   Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load

   F Em7

   And the buildings scrape the sky

   Cold wind rippling down the alley at dawn

   And the morning paper fly

   Dead man lying at the side of the road

   And the daylight in his eyes

   Chorus:

   Em7 D7

   Don't let it bring you down

   C

   It's only castles burning

   Bm7

   Find someone who's turning

   A

   And you will come around

   G A C A G A C

   Blind man running through the light of the night With an answer in his
   hand

   Come on down to the river of sight and

   You can really understand

   Red light flashin' through the window in the rain Can you hear the sirens
   moan?

   White cane lying in the gutter in the lane

   And you're walking home alone

   Chorus

   A

   Don't let it bring you down

   D

   It's only castles burning just

   Bm7

   Find someone who's turning

   A

   And you will come around

   G A C

   A G A C

   A

   Don't let it bring you down

   D

   It's only castles burning just

   Bm7

   Find someone who's turning

   A

   And you will come around

   G A C

   A D A D

   Moondance-(Morrison)

   Am Bm Am Bm

   Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance

   Am Bm Am Bm

   With the stars up above in your eyes

   Am Bm Am Bm

   A fantabulous night to make romance

   Am Bm Am Bm

   `Neath the cover of October skies

   Am Bm Am Bm

   You know, the leaves on the trees are falling

   Am Bm Am Bm

   To the sound of the breezes that blow

   Am Bm Am Bm

   And I'm tryin' to play to the calling

   Am Bm Am Bm

   Of your heart strings that play soft and low

   Dm Am Dm Am

   You know, the night's magic seems to whisper and hush

   Dm Am Bm E7

   You know, the soft moonlight seems to shine, and you blush

   Am Dm Am Dm Am--- Am (Dm Am Dm)?

   Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?

   Am Dm Am Dm Am--- Am E7

   Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

   Am Bm Am Bm

   Well, I wanna make love to you tonight

   Am Bm Am Bm

   I can't wait till the mornin' has come

   Am Bm Am Bm

   And I know now the time is just right

   Am Bm Am Bm

   And straight into my arms you will run

   Am Bm Am Bm

   When you come my heart will be waiting

   Am Bm Am Bm

   To make sure that you're never alone

   Am Bm Am Bm

   There and then all my dreams will come true dear

   Am Bm Am Bm

   There and then I will make you my own

   Dm Am Dm Am

   And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside

   Dm Am Bm E7

   And I know how much you want me that I can't hide

   Am Dm Am Dm Am--- Am (Dm Am Dm)?

   Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?

   Am Dm Am Dm Am--- Am E7

   Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

   Am Dm Am Dm Am--- Am

   Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

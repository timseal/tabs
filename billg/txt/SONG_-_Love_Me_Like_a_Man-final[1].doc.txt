   Love Me Like a Man by Chris Smither & Bonnie Raitt

   (E) These men that I been seeing, Baby - Got their soul upon the shelf.

   You know they could never love me When they can't even love themselves.

   But I (A) need someone to love me, Someone to really under- (E) stand,

   Who won't (B7) put himself above me, (A) Who just loves me like a (E) man
   (B7)

   (E) I never seen such losers, Darlin' - Even though I tried to find

   The man who could take me home Instead of taking me for a ride.

   And I (A) need someone to love me. I know you (E) can.

   Be- (B7) lieve me when I tell you, (A) You could love me like a (E) man
   (B7)

   BREAK

   A///A///E///E///

   A///A///E///E///

   B7///A///E///B7///

   (E) They all want me to rock them Like my back ain't got no bone.

   I want a man to rock me Like my backbone was his (A) own.

   But, Darlin', I know you (E) can.

   Be- (B7) lieve me when I tell you, (A) You could love me like a (E) man
   (B7)

   (E) I come home sad and lonely, Feel like I wanna cry.

   I want a man to hold me, Not some fool to ask me why.

   And I (A) need someone to love me. Darlin', I know you (E) can.

   Don't you (B7) put yourself above me, (A) You just love me like a (E) man.

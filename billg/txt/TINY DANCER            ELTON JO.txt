   TINY DANCER ELTON JOHN

   C F C F C F G

   Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band

   C F C F C F G

   Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man

   F Em Am D Dm E7 Am G

   Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand

   C F C F C G F Em Dm7

   And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

   C F C F C F G

   Jesus freaks out in the street handing tickets out for God

   C F C F C F G

   Turning back she just laughs, the boulevard is not that bad

   F Em Am D Dm E7 Am G

   Piano man, he makes his stand in the auditorium

   C F C F C G F Em Dm7

   Looking on she sings the songs the words she knows, the tune she hums

   G# Bb

   But oh how it feels so real

   Gm Cm

   Lying here with no one near

   G# Bb

   Only you and you can hear me

   G

   When I say softly, slowly

   F C Dm

   Hold me closer tiny dancer

   F C G

   Count the headlights on the highway

   F C Dm

   Lay me down in sheets of linen

   F C G

   you had a busy day today

   F C Dm

   Hold me closer tiny dancer

   F C G

   Count the headlights on the highway

   F C Dm

   Lay me down in sheets of linen

   F C G

   you had a busy day today

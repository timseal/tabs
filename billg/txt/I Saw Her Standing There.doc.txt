   I Saw Her Standing There

   Lennon/McCartney

   A D7

   Well she was just seventeen, if you know what I mean,

   A E7

   And the way she looked was way beyond compare,

   A A7 DF A E7 A

   So how could I dance with another, when I saw her standing there.

   A D7

   Well she looked at me, and I, I could see,

   A E7

   That before too long I'd fall in love with her.

   A A7 D F A E7 A

   She wouldn't dance with another, when I saw her standing there.

   D7

   Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room,

   E D

   And I held her hand in mine...

   A D7

   Well we danced through the night, and we held each other tight,

   A E7

   And before too long I fell in love with her.

   A A7 D F A E7 A

   Now I'll never dance with another, since I saw her standing there.

   [Instrumental same as verse]

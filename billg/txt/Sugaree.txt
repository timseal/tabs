   Sugaree-The Grateful Dead

   B Thing E Thing (x4)

   B Thing E Thing B Thing E Thing

   When they come to take you down, when they bring that wagon round

   B Thing E Thing B Thing E Thing

   When they come to call on you, and drag your poor body down

   F#m C#m --> A E add4

   Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me

   B C#m A E add4

   Please forget you knew my name, my darlin' Sugaree

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   *Solo* B Thing E Thing (repeat)

   B Thing E Thing B Thing E Thing

   You thought you was the cool fool, never could do no wrong

   B Thing E Thing B Thing E Thing

   You had everything sewed up tight, how come you lay awake all night long?

   F#m C#m --> A E add4

   Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me

   B C#m A E add4

   Please forget you knew my name, my darlin' Sugaree

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   *Solo* B Thing E Thing (repeat)

   B Thing E Thing

   You know in spite of all you gained,

   B Thing E Thing

   you still have to stand out in the pouring rain

   B Thing E Thing B Thing E Thing

   One last voice is calling you, and I guess it's time you go

   F#m C#m --> A E add4

   Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me

   B C#m A E add4

   Please forget you knew my name, my darlin' Sugaree

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   *Solo* B Thing E Thing (repeat)

   B Thing E Thing B Thing E Thing

   Shake it up now, shake it Sugaree, I'll meet you at the jubilee

   B Thing E Thing B Thing E Thing

   And if that jubilee don't come, baby I'll meet you on the run

   F#m C#m --> A E add4

   Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me

   B C#m A E add4

   Please forget you knew my name, my darlin' Sugaree

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

   B Thing -- Eadd4 C#m A E

   Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them you know me

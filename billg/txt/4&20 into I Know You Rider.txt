   D

   Four and twenty years ago, I come into this life,

   D

   the son of a woman and a man who lived in strife.

   F G D

   He was tired of bein' poor,

   F G D

   and he wasn't into sellin' door to door,

   F G D

   and he worked like the devil to be more.

   A different kind of poverty now upsets me so;

   night after sleepless night, I walk the floor and I want to know,

   why am I so alone?

   Where is my woman, can I bring her home?

   Have I driven her away? Is she gone?

   Morning comes the sunrise and I'm driven to my bed.

   I see it is empty and there's devils in my head.

   I embrace the many-colored beast.

   I grow weary of the torment can there be no peace?

   And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.

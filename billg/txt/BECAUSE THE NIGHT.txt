   Because the night belongs to lust.

   Bm G A Bm

   Bm G A Bm

   Because the night belongs to us.

   Have I doubt when I'm alone?

   Love is a ring on the telephone.

   Love is an angel disguised as lust,

   here in our bed until the morning comes.

   Come on now, try and understand

   the way I feel under your command.

   Take my hand as the sun descends.

   They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now.

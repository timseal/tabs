   It Makes No Difference  J.R.Robertson

   G  C D  G C G

   G  C D  G C G

   C     G/B   g f Em

   It makes no diff'rence where I turn

   Em G/D  Am7

   I can't get over you and the flame still burns

   C    G/B  g f Em

   It makes no diff'rence, night or day

   Em  G/D C  D 

   The shadow never seems to fade away

   G    C  D   G  C G

   And the sun don't shine anymore

   G    C D  G C G

   And the rains fall down on my door

   G

   Now there's no love

   Dm

   As true as the love

   C A7

   That dies untold

   G    C  D  G C G

   But the clouds never hung so low before

   C   G/B g f Em

   It makes no diff'rence how far I go

   Em G/D Am7

   Like a scar the hurt will always show

   C   G/B g f Em

   It makes no diff'rence who I meet

   Em G/D

   They're just a face in the crowd

   Am7 

   On a dead-end street

   G    C D   G C G

   And the sun don't shine anymore

   G    C D  G C G

   And the rains fall down on my door

   G

   These old love letters

   Dm

   Well, I just can't keep

   C

   'Cause like the gambler says

   A7

   Read 'em and weep

   G   C D   G C G

   And the dawn don't rescue me  any more

   D  Em

   Without your love I'm nothing at all

   C A7

   Like an empty hall it's a lonely fall

   D    Em

   Since you've gone it's a losing battle

   C

   Stampeding cattle

   A7    D

   They rattle the walls

   G  C D  G C G

   And the sun don't shine anymore

   G  C D G C G

   And the rains fall down on my door

   G

   Well, I love you so much

   Dm

   It's all I can do

   C  A7

   Just to keep myself from telling you

   G  C D  G C G

   That I never felt so alone before

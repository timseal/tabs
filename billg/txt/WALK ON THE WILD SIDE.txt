   WALK ON THE WILD SIDE

   LOU REED

   G C

   Holly came from Miami, F.L.A.

   G C

   Hitchhiked her way across the U.S.A.

   G D

   Plucked her eyebrows on the way,

   C D

   Shaved her legs & then he was a she, she said

   G C

   Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side,

   G C

   Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

   G C

   Candy came from out on the island

   G C

   In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'

   G D

   But she never lost her head

   C D

   Even when she was givin' head, she said

   G C

   Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side,

   G C

   Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

   And the colored girls go:

   G C

   Doo, d-doo, d-doo, doo d-doo doo, d-doo, d-doo, doo d-doo

   G C

   Doo, d-doo, d-doo, doo d-doo doo, d-doo, d-doo, doo d-doo

   G C

   Little Joe never once gave it away

   G C

   Everybody had to pay and pay

   G D

   A hustle here and a hustle there

   C D

   New York City is that place where they say

   G C

   Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side,

   G C

   Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

   G C

   Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the street

   G C

   Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat

   G D C D

   Went to the Apollo, you should have seen him go, go go they said ..

   G C

   Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side,

   G C

   Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

   G C

   Jackie is just speedin' away

   G C Thought she was James Dean for a day

   G D

   Then I guess she had to crash

   C D

   Valium could've helped that bash, I said

   G C

   Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side,

   G C

   Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

   And the colored girls go:

   G C

   Doo, d-doo, d-doo, doo d-doo doo, d-doo, d-doo, doo d-doo

   G C

   Doo, d-doo, d-doo, doo d-doo doo, d-doo, d- doo, doo d-doo

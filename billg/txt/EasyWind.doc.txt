   Easy Wind-Dead (Hunter)

   [Intro]

   E7

   I been balling a shiny black steel jack-hammer,

   A7

   Been chippin' up rocks for the great highway,

   E7 A7

   E7

   I'll live five years if I take my time,

   A7

   Ballin' that jack and a drinkin' my wine.

   E7 A7

   E7

   I been chippin' them rocks from dawn till doom,

   A7

   While my rider hide my bottle in the other room.

   E7 A7

   E7

   Doctor say better stop ballin' that jack,

   A7

   If I live five years I gonna bust my back, yes I will.

   [Chorus Intro]

   A7 E7

   Easy wind cross the Bayou today

   A7

   Cause there's a whole lotta women, mama,

   E7

   Out in red on the streets today.

   B

   And the river keeps a talkin',

   A C E

   But you never heard a word it said.

   [Chorus Outro]

   E7

   Gotta find a woman be good to me,

   A7

   Won't hide my liquor try to serve me tea,

   E7 A7

   E7

   Cause I'm a stone jack baller and my heart is true

   A7

   And I'll give everything that I got to you, yes I will.

   [Chorus Intro]

   A7 E7

   Easy wind cross the Bayou today

   A7

   Cause there's a whole lotta women, mama,

   E7

   Out in red on the streets today.

   B

   And the river keeps a talkin',

   A C E

   But you never heard a word it said.

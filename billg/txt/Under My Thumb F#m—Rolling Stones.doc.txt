   Under My Thumb -Rolling Stones

   F#m E D

   Under my thumb's the girl who once had me down,

   F#m E D

   under my thumb's the girl who once pushed me around,

   A D B

   it's down to me, the diff'rence in the clothes she wears,

   F#m E D A

   it's down to me, the change has come, she's under my thumb.

   F#m E  D

   Under my thumb`s a squirming dog who`s just had her days,

   F#m E D

   under my thumb's a girl who has just changed her ways,

   A D  B

   it's down to me, the way she does just what she's told,

   F#m E D A

   it's down to me, the change has come, she's under my thumb.

   F#m E D

   Under my thumb's a Siamese cat of a girl,

   F#m  E D

   under my thumb she's the sweetest pet in the world,

   A D  B

   it's down to me, the way she does just what she's told,

   F#m E D A

   it's down to me, the change has come, she's under my thumb.

   F#m E D

   Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself,

   F#m  E D

   under my thumb, well, I can still look at someone else,

   A D  B

   it's down to me, the way she talks when she's spoken to,

   F#m E D A

   it's down to me, the change has come, she's under my thumb.

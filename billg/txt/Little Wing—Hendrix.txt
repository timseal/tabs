   Em G

   Well, she's walkin' through the clouds

   Am Em

   A circus smile that's running wild

   Bm Am C G

   Butterflies and zebras and fairy tales

   F C

   Is all she ever thinks about

   D

   Runnin' with the wind

   Em G

   And when I'm sad she comes to me

   Am Em

   A thousand smiles she gives to me free

   Bm Am

   She said it's all right

   C G

   Take anything that you want from me

   F C

   Anything

   D

   Anything

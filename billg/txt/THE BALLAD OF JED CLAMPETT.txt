   THE BALLAD OF JED CLAMPETT

   Earl Scruggs

   G Am D

   Come listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed

   G6 G

   A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed

   C Bm

   Then one day he was shootin' at some food

   D G6 G

   And up through the ground came a-bubblin' crude

   Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea.

   Well, the first thing you know old Jed's a millionaire

   The kin folks said "Jed move away from there"

   Said "California's the place you ought to be"

   So they bundled up the truck and moved to Beverly

   Hills that is. Swimmin' pools. Movie stars.

   Well, now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin

   They would like to thank you for kindly stoppin' in

   You're all invited back next week to this locality

   To have a heapin' helpin' of their hospitality

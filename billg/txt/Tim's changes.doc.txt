   C G/B (or Bm)

   It makes no diff'rence where I turn

   Em G/D Am7

   I can't get over you and the flame still burns

   C G/B

   It makes no diff'rence, night or day

   Em G/D C D

   The shadow never seems to fade away

   G

   Now there's no love

   Dm

   As true as the love

   C A7

   That dies untold

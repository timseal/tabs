   Studebaker

   G D Em // C G // D G D Em // C D

     G
   I left my home in Monterey
     D
   just another low prospects man.
       Am
   I'd rather work in the foundry
       Em C
   than put fishes in a can.  
       C       G       D
   I'm thirty-five and I haven't traveled far,
       Am         Em C
   and I've spent all my money on this misbegotten car.  

       Bm C Am
   I'm up against it all like a leaf against the wind
       G     Em       C
   and this Studebaker keeps on breaking down again.  
       Am    G       D C G
   My Studebaker keeps on breaking down again.  
    
     G       G7      C    A7
   I thought I'd go to Fresno just to see my friend  
     D G C G D G
   but my damn Studebaker keeps on breaking down again.  

    

   G

   I was speeding south on ninety-nine    
   D

   when the manifold started smokin'  
   Am

   I ran her off the shoulder  
   Em C

   and now the axle's broken.  

   C G D

   It made a sound that cracked my heart in half

   Am Em C  
   and with only half a half pint of vodka left.  
      

   Bm C Am
   I'm up against it all like a leaf against the wind

       G     Em       C
   and this Studebaker keeps on breaking down again.  
       Am    G       D C G
   My Studebaker keeps on breaking down again.  
    
     G       G7      C    A7
   I thought I'd go to Fresno just to see my friend  
     D G C G D G
   but my damn Studebaker keeps on breaking down again.  

   G Em C   
   My Studebaker keeps on breakin' down again.  
   Am G D C G

   My Studebaker keeps on breakin' down again.  
      G G7 C A7
   I thought I'd go to Fresno just to see my friend

   D G C G D G
   but my damn Studebaker keeps on breaking down again

   Verse 1:

   C E/B Am C/G

   Bell Bottom Blues, you made me cry

   F G F C G [Riff 1]

   I don't wanna lose this feeling

   C E/B Am C/G

   If I could choose a place to die

   F G

   It would be in your arms

   Chorus:

   A Amaj7 F#m D E

   Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you

   Do you wanna hear me beg you to take me back

   D E

   I'd gladly do it, because

   A Amaj7/C# A7 D E

   It's all wrong, but it's all right

   You won't find a better loser

   [repeat chorus] [guitar solo over verse chords] [repeat chorus]

   Verse 3:

   Bell Bottom Blues, don't say goodbye

   We're surely gonna meet again

   And if we do, dontcha be surprised

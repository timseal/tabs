   ANGEL FROM MONTGOMERY

   G C G C

   I am an old man named after my father.

   G C D C

   My old lady's another child that's grown old.

   G C G C

   If dreams were thunder and lightning was desire

   G C D G

   this old house would've burnt down a long time ago

   CHORUS

   G F C G

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   G F C G

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   G F C G

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   G F C G

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   G C G C

   When I was a young man I had me a cowgirl,

   G C D C

   wa'n't much to look at, just a free ramblin' child.

   G C G C

   But that was a long time, and no matter how I try,

   G C D G

   the years just flow by like a broken-down dam.

   CHORUS

   G F C G

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   G F C G

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   G F C G

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   G F C G

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   G C G C

   There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear all their buzzin'

   G C D C

   but I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today.

   G C G C

   How can a person goes to work in the morning

   G C D G

   come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say.

   CHORUS

   G F C G

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   G F C G

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   G F C G

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   G F C G

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   G F C G

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   Wicked Games--Chris Isaak}

   [Bm]World was on fire, [A]no one could save me [E]but you

   [Bm]What strange world desire [A]will make foolish [E]people do do

   [Bm]I never dreamed that [A]I'd meet somebody like [E]you

   [Bm]I never dreamed that [A]I'd lose somebody like [E]you

   chorus

   [Bm]Now [A]I want to fall in [E]love

   [Bm]Now [A]I want to fall in [E]love

   With [Bm]you [A] [E]

   What a wicked game to play to make me feel this way

   What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

   What a wicked thing to say you never felt that way

   What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

   chorus

   [Bm]Now [A]I want to fall in [E]love

   [Bm]Now [A]I want to fall in [E]love

   With [Bm]you [A] [E]

   Breathe -Pink Floyd)

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Breathe, breathe in the air

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Don't be afraid to care

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Leave, but don't leave me

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Look around, choose your own ground

   Cmaj7

   For long you live and high you fly

   Bm Bm7

   Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry

   Fmaj7

   And all you touch and all you see

   G D7#9 (or F) Em

   Is all your life will ever be

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Run, rabbit, run

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Dig that hole, forget the sun

   Em(add F#) A As

   And when at last the work is done

   Em(add F#) A Asus4

   Don't sit down it's time to dig another one

   Cmaj7

   For long you live and high you'll fly

   Bm

   But only if you ride the tide

   Fmaj7

   And balanced on the biggest wave

   G D7#9 (or F) Em

   You race towards an early grave

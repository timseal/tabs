   LOUISE, BONNIE RAITT

   G D7

   THEY ALL SAID LOUISE WAS NOT HALF BAD

   C D7 G

   IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE WALLS AND WINDOW SHADES

   D7

   AND HOW SHE'D ACT THE LITTLE GIRL

   C D7 G

   THE DECEIVER, DON'T BELIEVE HER, THAT'S HER TRADE

   C D7 G

   SOMETIMES A BOTTLE OF PERFUME

   C D7 G

   FLOWERS AND MAYBE SOME LACE

   C D7 Em

   MEN BROUGHT LOUISE 10 CENT TRINKETS

   C D7

   THEIR INTENTIONS WERE EASILY TRACED

   G D7

   AH, AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT KINDA SAD

   C D7 G

   WHEN THEY FOUND LOUISE IN HER ROOM

   D7

   THEY'D ALL PUT HER DOWN BELOW THEIR KIND

   C D7 G

   STILL SOME CRIED WHEN SHE DIED THIS AFTERNOON

   C D7 G

   LOUISE RODE HOME ON THE MAIL TRAIN

   C D7 G

   SOMEWHERE TO THE SOUTH I HEARD 'EM SAY

   C D7 Em

   TOO BAD IT ENDED SO UGLY

   C D7

   TOO BAD SHE HAD TO GO THAT WAY

   G D7

   BUT THE WIND IS BLOWIN COLD TONIGHT

   C D7 G

   GOOD NIGHT LOUISE GOOD NIGHT

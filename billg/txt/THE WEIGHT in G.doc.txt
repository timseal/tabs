   G Bm C G

   I pulled in to Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead.

   G Bm C G

   I just need some place where I can lay my head.

   G Bm C G

   "Hey, Mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"

   G Bm C G

   He just grinned, shook my hand, "No" was all he said.

   G D C

   Take a load off, Fanny.

   G D C

   Take a load for free.

   G D C

   Take a load off, Fanny.

   C G D Em Bm C

   And... you put the load right on me.

   C G D Em Bm C

   G Bm C G

   I picked up my bag. I went looking for a place to hide.

   G Bm C G

   When I saw Carmen and the devil walking side by side.

   G Bm C G

   I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on. Let's go downtown."

   G Bm C G

   She said, "I got to go, but my friend can stick around."

   G D C

   Take a load off, Fanny.

   Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say.

   G Bm C G

   It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgement day.

   G Bm C G

   "Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"

   G Bm C G

   He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company."

   [Repeat Chorus]

   G Bm C G

   Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog.

   G Bm C G

   He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack my dog."

   G Bm C G

   I said, "Wait a minute, Chester. You know I'm a peaceful man."

   G Bm C G

   He said, "That's okay, boy. Won't you feed him when you can?"

   Get your cannonball now, to take me down the line.

   G Bm C G

   My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time

   G Bm C G

   To get back to Miss Fanny, You know she's the only one

   G Bm C G

   Who sent me here with her regards for everyone.

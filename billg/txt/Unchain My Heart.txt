   Unchain My Heart--Ray Charles

     

   Am Dm7 Am (x2)

   (no chord) Am

   Unchain my heart, baby let me be

   F7 Am

   Unchain my heart, cause you don't care about me

   Dm7 Am

   You got me sewed up like a pillow case

   Dm7 Am

   But you lettin' my love go to waste 

   F7 E7 Am Dm7 Am

   So unchain my heart, oh please baby, set me free

   Unchain my heart, baby let me go

   Unchain my heart, cause you don't love me no more

   Everytime I call you on the phone

   Some fellow tells me that you're not at home

   So unchain my heart, oh please baby, set me free

   Dm7 Am

   I'm under your spell, like a man in a trance

   Dm7 E7

   But I know darn well, that I don't stand a chance

   So unchain my heart, let me go my way

   Unchain my heart, you worried me that day

   Why lead me through a life of misery

   When you don't care a bag of beans for me

   So unchain my heart, oh please baby, set me free

   *Solo* (verse)

   I'm under your spell, like a man in a trance

   Whoa! But I know darn well, that I don't stand a chance

   So unchain my heart, let me go my way

   Unchain my heart, you worried me that day

   Why lead me through a life of misery

   When you don't care a bag of beans for me

   So unchain my heart, oh please baby, set me free

   Am Dm7 Am

   Oh, won't you set me free

   Whoa, set me free

   Wow!! Set me free, little doll

   Oh, won't you set me free...

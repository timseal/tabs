   Wish You Were Here-Pink Floyd

   [Chords to intro riff]

   Em / G / Em / G / Em / Am7 / Em / Am7 / G / G

   C D Am G

   So, so you think you can tell, heaven from hell? Blue skies from pain?

   D C Am

   Can you tell a green field, from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil?

   G C D

   Do you think you can tell? Did they get you to trade, your heroes for
   ghosts?

   Am G D

   Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change

   C Am G

   And did you exchange, a walk-on part in the war, for a lead role in a
   cage...

   [Guitar solo over intro riff]

   Em / G / Em / G / Em / Am7 / Em / Am7 / G / G

   C D

   How I wish, how I wish you were here

   Am G D

   We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year

   C Am

   Running over the same old ground, what have we found - the same old fears?

   G

   Wish you were here

   Sarita--Subdudes

   worried me

   you were someone that I could talk to

   we helped each other get through

   those times that had to be

   Sarita, Sarita, Sarita sweet you've been to me

   Sarita, Sarita, Sarita  sweet you've been to me

   I showed your picture to my friend here  and he said that you looked

   pretty sexy to him  I said well you know she was that and more  how I wish

   that I could see you again

   Sarita, Sarita, Sarita sweet you've been to me  Sarita, Sarita, Sarita

   sweet you've been to me

   How does a person make the name  or is it the other way around

   You know  Sarita fit  I don't think she ever questioned it  little girl,
   she'd just

   laugh, say yeah  let's dance, say yeah, come on

   Now when my mother told me about it  it like to hit my heart so  hard that

   it nearly broke  laughing dancer, bold romancer  save a dance for me in

   eternity

   Sarita, Sarita, Sarita sweet you've been to me  Sarita, Sarita, Sarita

   sweet you've been to me

   Sarita, Sarita, Sarita save a dance for me  in eternity

   I'm gonna wait till the stars come out

   And see the twinkle in your eye.

   I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour.

   That's when my love begins to shine.

   That really loves me so,

   In the midnight hour.

   Oh yeah, in the midnight hour.

   Just you you and I.

   Oh baby, Ha, just you and I.

   Nobody around, baby, just you and I.

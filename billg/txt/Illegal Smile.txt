   Illegal Smile (John Prine)

   G D C G

   When I woke up this morning, things were lookin' bad

   C G D G

   seems like total silence is the only friend I have

   D C G C G

   a bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won

   D C G C G

   and it was twelve o'clock before I realized that I was havin' no fun

   {chorus}

   D G C D G

   but fortunately I have the key to escape reality

   step up to) C G

   and you may see me tonight with an illegal smile

   D G

   it don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while

   C G

   won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone

   D C G C G C G C ...

   no I was just tryin' to have me some fun

   G D C G

   last time I checked my bankroll, well it was gettin' thin

   C G D

   sometimes it seems like the bottom is the only place I've been

   D C G C G

   chased a rainbow down a one-way street... dead end

   D C G C G

   and all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen

   {repeat chorus}

   G D C G

   I sat down in my closet with all my overalls

   C G D

   just tryin' to get away from all the years inside these walls

   D C G C G

   dreamed the police heard everything I thought... what then?

   D C G C G

   well I went to court and the judge's name was Hoffman

   {repeat chorus}

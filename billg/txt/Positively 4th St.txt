   Positively 4th St. (Dylan)

   Intro

   G

   G Am C G

   You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend

   G D C Em D

   When I was down you just stood there grinning

   G Am C G

   You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend

   G D C Em D

   You just want to be on the side that's winning

   G Am C G

   You say I let you down you know it's not like that

   G D C Em D

   If you're so hurt why then don't you show it

   G Am C G

   You say you lost your faith but that's not where it's at

   G D C Em D

   You had no faith to lose and you know it

   I know the reason that you talk behind my back

   I used to be among the crowd you're in with

   Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact

   With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

   You see me on the street you always act surprised

   You say, "How are you?" "Good luck" but you don't mean it

   When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed

   Why don't you just come out once and scream it

   No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace

   If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them

   And now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place

   Don't you understand it's not my problem

   I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes

   And just for that one moment I could be you

   Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes

   You'd know what a drag it is to see you

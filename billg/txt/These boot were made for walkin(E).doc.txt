   These boot were made for walkin' (in E)

   Somethin' you call love but confess

   [A]You been messin' where you shouldn't been messin'

   And now [E]someone else is getting all your best

   Chorus

   These [G]boots were made for [E]walking 'n' [G]that's just what the'll
   [E]do

   [G]One of these days these [E]boots are gonna walk all over you

   [E]You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'

   You keep losing when you oughta not bet

   [A]You keep samein' where you oughta be changin'

   Now what's [E]right is right, but you ain't been right yet

   Chorus (or lead over E only riff)

   These [G]boots were made for [E]walking 'n' [G]that's just what the'll
   [E]do

   [G]One of these days these [E]boots are gonna walk all over you

   [E]You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'

   You keep thinking that tou'll never get burned

   [A]I just found me a brand new box of matches

   And [E]what she knows you ain't got time to learn

   These [G]boots were made for [E]walking 'n' [G]that's just what the'll

   [G]One of these days these [E]boots are gonna walk all over you

   G C G

   Some people they got animal attraction

   G C D

   Some got magnetic person al i ties

   C G

   I got nasty habits, you can see, son

   G D G

   But a well-developed sense of irony

   G C G

   Some people they stay sweethearts till forever

   G C D

   Couples till its sleepy dirtnap time

   C G

   Them people's other people, they ain't me, son

   G D G

   I settle for my Gibson and a rhyme

   [Walk to Chorus]

   [Chorus]

   C

   Titty Bars, Guitars and Reefer

   G C G

   Ain't exactly all the rage

   G

   But they're sure a damn good cure for

   D G

   Boring shit like middle age

   C

   Heaven Hill and 6L6's

   G

   Pickin' tunes and tweakin' mixes

   D

   Guys like us we just need fixes

   C G

   So broken hearts can turn the page

   [Bridge]

   C

   When you look closer cowboys,

   G

   they ain't cowboys

   C G

   Just Jewboys with a night to blow off steam

   C

   Heaven Hill and other thrills

   G

   Middle-aged prescription pills

   D

   Pickin' sure don't pay my bills

   C G

   But it sure does set me free

   C

   One more song it won't take long

   G

   A cover tune, you'll get home soon

   D

   Too late to be the man you thought

   C G

   Too early to be me

   C

   Maker's Mark and Cutty Sark

   G

   And singin' like you're much more dark

   D

   It's too late to make your mark

   C G

   But not too late to play

   [Walk to Chorus]

   [Chorus]

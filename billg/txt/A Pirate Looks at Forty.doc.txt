   A Pirate Looks at Forty

   By: Jimmy Buffett

   G

   Mother, mother ocean

   I have heard you call

   C D

   I wanted to sail upon your waters

   Am7 G

   since I was three feet tall

   Am D

   You've seen it all

   Am7 G

   You've seen it all

   I watched the men who rode you

   Switch from sails to steam

   And in your belly you hold the treasure

   That few have ever seen

   Most of them dreams

   Most of them dreams

   Yes, I am a pirate

   Two hundred years too late

   The cannons don't thunder

   There's nothin' to plunder

   I'm an over forty victim of fate

   Arriving too late

   Arriving too late

   I've done a bit of smugglin'

   I've run my share of grass

   I made enough money to buy Miami

   But I pissed it away so fast

   Never meant to last

   Never meant to last

   I have been drunk now

   For over two weeks,

   I passed out and I rallied

   And I sprung a few leaks,

   But I've got stop wishin'

   Got to go fishin'

   I'm down to rock bottom again

   Just a few friends

   Just a few friends

   I go for younger women

   Lived with several awhile

   And though I ran away

   They'll come back one day

   And I still can manage a smile

   It just takes a while

   Just takes a while

   Mother, mother ocean

   After all these years I've found

   My occupational hazard being

   My occupation's just not around

   I feel like I've drowned

   Gonna head uptown

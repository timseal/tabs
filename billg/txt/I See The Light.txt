   Good times now

   D A Em

   I can see the light

   On this road I'm walkin' on

   I see my way

   Paradise I'm livin' for

   Each and every day

   About the crossroads of the past

   Nothing more to say

   Good times now

   I can see my way

   In this sea I'm movin' through

   Feel my life complete

   With the one I'm livin' for

   Time is oh, so sweet

   Feelin' us together

   ?Livin' in the bright?

   Good times now,

   I can see the light

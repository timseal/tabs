   Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner Warren Zevon

   Bm D G

   Roland was a warrior from the Land of the Midnight Sun

   G D A*

   With a Thompson gun for hire, fighting to be done

   Bm D G

   The deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day

   G D A Bm

   So he set out for Biafra to join the bloody fray

   Bm D G

   Through sixty-six and seven they fought the Congo war

   G D A

   Fingers on their triggers, knee-deep in gore

   Bm D G

   For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees

   G D A Bm

   They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese

   G D A Bm

   Roland the Thompson gunner...

   G D A Bm

   Roland the Thompson gunner...

   Bm D G

   His comrades fought beside him - Van Owen and the rest

   G D A

   But of all the Thompson gunners Roland was the best

   Bm D G

   So the CIA decided they wanted Roland dead

   G D A Bm

   That son-of-a-bitch Van Owen blew off Roland's head

   Chorus: Harmony:

   D A G Bm

   Roland the headless Thompson gunner (Time, time, time

   D A For another peaceful war

   Norway's bravest son But time stands still for

   Roland

   'Til he evens up the score)

   A Bm A D A G Bm

   They can still see his headless body stalking through the night

   D A Bm

   In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun

   D A G Bm

   In the muzzle flash of Roland's Thompson gun

   Bm D G

   Roland searched the continent for the man who'd done him in

   G D A

   He found him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin

   Bm D G

   Roland aimed his Thompson gun - he didn't say a word

   G D A Bm

   But he blew Van Owen's body from there to Johannesburg

   G D A Bm

   Roland the headless Thompson gunner...

   G D A Bm

   Roland the headless Thompson gunner...

   G D A Bm

   Roland the headless Thompson gunner...

   Bm D G

   The eternal Thompson gunner, still wandering through the night

   G D A

   Now it's ten years later but he still keeps up the fight

   Bm D G

   In Ireland, in Lebanon, in Palestine and Berkeley

   G G G D

   Patty Hearst heard the burst of Roland's Thompson gun

   A Bm

   And bought it

   All the A cords can be played as a regular A or O O 2 2 O O, [I forget

   the name of this cord]

   Intro:

   Am Dm  G C

   Times are hard, you're afraid to pay the fee

   Oh yeah

   [ADD 1X count of verse chorus guitar instrumental]

   Am Dm G C

   Light the candle, put the lock upon the door

   Am Dm C G

   You have sent the maid home early like a thousand times before

   Am Dm G C

   Like a castle in a corner in a medieval game

   Am Dm C D

   I forsee terrible trouble and I stay here just the same

   Turn on your love light - The Grateful Dead

   Without a warning you broke my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart

   And you left me standin' in the dark, said your love for me was dyin'.

   Come on baby, baby please come on baby, cause I'm on my knees.

   Turn on your lights let it shine on me shine on your love light

   Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine.

   When I get lonely in the middle of the night

   And I need you darlin' to make things alright

   So come on baby, baby please and I'm beggin' you baby cause

   I'm on my knees,

   Turn on your lights let it shine on me

   Turn on your love light let it shine on me

   Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

   Without a warning you broke my heart, takin' it baby, tore it apart

   And you left me standin' in the dark, shine your love let it shine on me.

   Come on baby, baby please come on baby, cause I'm on my knees.

   Turn on your lights let it shine on me shine on your love light

   Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine.

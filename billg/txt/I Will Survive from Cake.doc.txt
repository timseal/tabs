   I Will Survive from Cake. Album Fashion nugget

   verses/chorus:

   Am Dm G C F B E

   Am Dm

   at first i was afraid i was petrified

   G C

   i was thinking i could never live without you by my side

   F B

   but then i spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong

   E

   i grew strong i learned how to get along etc.

   And so you're back from outer space.

   I just walked in to find you here

   Without that look upon your face.

   I should have changed my fucking lock.

   I would have made you leave your key

   If I'd have known for just one second

   You'd be back to bother me.

   Oh now go.

   Walk out the door.

   Just turn around now.

   You're not welcome anymore.

   Weren't you the one

   Who tried to break me with desire?

   Did you think I'd crumble?

   Did you think I'd lay down and die?

   Oh not I.

   I will survive.

   As long as I know how to love

   I know I'll be alive.

   I've got all my life to live.

   I've got all my love to give.

   I will survive.

   I will survive.

   It took all the strength I had

   Just not to fall apart.

   I'm trying hard to mend

   The pieces of my broken heart.

   And I spent oh so many nights

   Just feeling sorry for myself.

   I used to cry.

   But now I hold my head up high.

   And you'll see me with somebody new.

   I'm not that stupid little person

   Still in love with you.

   And so you thought you'd just drop by,

   And you expect me to be free.

   But now I'm saving all my lovin'

   For someone who's lovin' me.

   Oh now go.

   Walk out the door.

   Just turn around now.

   You're not welcome anymore.

   Weren't you the one

   Who tried to break me with desire?

   Did you think I'd crumble?

   Did you think I'd lay down and die?

   Oh not I.

   I will survive.

   As long as I know how to love

   I know I'll be alive.

   I've got all my life to live.

   I've got all my love to give.

   I will survive.

   I will survive.

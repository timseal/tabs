   verse

   E

   I don't wanna see you drafting no soldier

   I just can't be myself, I up and told her

   I heard all bout the nasty shit she sold her

   I seen all how the G-man bank-a-rolled her (salad escaroled her)

   I seen yo' baby and must say I adore her

   (the gulf)

   Put my helmet on and I'm a gee-oh-graff explorer

   I don't wanna cause no catechistic schism

   I just wanna gaze inside yo prizm

   refrain

   Bb A

   I wanna love you (, ) body and soul

   I don't ever (,) wanna let go

   I don't wanna ever come out

   E

   You' know what it's all about

   verse

   I saw you w yo hand inside a puppet

   I heard Ketchup Lady say to shove it!

   When you have a bird, you got to stuff it

   When u got no bird, u got to rough it

   She done set you up -- uh -- wid-duh hair man

   What u really want is a repair man

   Who can snake your drain and get it runnin

   So U can get back out in the sun-nin

   refrain

   Bb A

   I wanna love you (, ) body and soul

   I don't ever (,) wanna let go

   I don't wanna ever come out

   E

   You' know what it's all about

   I don't wanna be no one who Cajoled her

   I might wanna be someone known to ` rolled her

   I don't wanna be Pinned down by a boulder

   I just wanna help load up yer bazolder

   I can't carry the world upon my shoulder

   I just wanna put my cup up in your holder (file in your folder,

   warm up in your colder)

   I just wanna dance inside your circle

   I wander round like a drunken/ delirious turtle

   I just wanna go crawlin in yo myrtle

   I just wanna clear the final hurdle.

   I just wanna get up inside your head, babe (aside your ledge) ( legs) (buy
   up all yo eggs,)

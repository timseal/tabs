   FLAG DECAL By John Prine

   C

   Well while digesting Reader's Digest

   C7

   In the back of a dirty book store,

   F

   A flag decal, with gum on the back,

   C

   Fell out on the floor.

   C

   So I picked it up and I ran outside

   C7

   And I slapped on my window shield,

   F

   And if I could see old Betsy Ross now

   G C

   I tell her how good I feel.

   ch.

   F

   Oh but your flag decal won't get you

   C

   Into Heaven any more.

   G

   They're already overcrowded

   F C

   From your dirty little wars.

   F

   Now Jesus he don't like killin'

   C

   No matter what the reason if for,

   G

   And your flag decal won't get you

   G7 C

   Into Heaven any more.

   (Well) I went into the bank this morning

   and the teller she said to me,

   "If you join our Christmas club

   we'll give you ten of those flags for free."

   So I didn't mess around a bit

   and I took her up on what she said.

   And I stuck those stickers all over my car

   And one on my wife's forehead.

   (Chorus)

   (Well) I got my car so stickered up

   That I couldn't see.

   Then I ran it right upside a curb

   And then right into a tree.

   By the time they called a doctor down

   I was already dead.

   And I'll never understand why the man

   Standing at the Pearly Gates said...

   F

   Oh but your flag decal won't get you

   C

   Into Heaven any more.

   G

   They're already overcrowded

   F C

   From your dirty little wars.

   F

   Now Jesus he don't like killin'

   C

   No matter what the reason if for,

   G

   And your flag decal won't get you

   G7 C

   Into Heaven any more.

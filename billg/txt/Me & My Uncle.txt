   Me & My Uncle  Skull & Roses (Phillips)

   Em B Em

   G Em

   Well, me & my uncle went ridin' down

   G Em

   South Colorado, west Texas bound

   G Em

   We stopped over in Sante Fe

   G G# A

   That bein' the point just about half-way

   G B Em

   And you know it was the hottest part of the day

   G Em

   I took the horses up to the stalls

   G Em

   Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all

   G Em

   Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt

   G G# A

   It bein' summer, I took off my shirt

   G B Em

   And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt.

   G Em

   West Texas cowboys, they's all around,

   G Em

   With liquor and money, they's loaded down,

   G Em

   So soon after pay day, you know it seemed a shame

   G G# A

   You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game

   G B Em

   High, Low, Jack, and the winner takes the hand.

   G Em

   My uncle started winnin', cowboys got sore

   G Em

   One of them called him, and then two more,

   G Em

   Accused him of cheatin', now I know, it couldn't be

   G G# A

   I know my uncle, and he's as honest as me

   G B Em

   Yeah, and I'm as honest as a Denver* man can be.

   G Em

   So one of them cowboys, he starts to draw,

   G Em

   I shot him down Lord, he never saw, **

   G Em

   Shot me another, that man, he won't grow old.

   G G# A

   In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold

   G B Em

   And we high-tailed it down to Mexico

   G Em

   Now, all those cowboys, out of their gold

   G Em

   Loved my uncle, God rest his soul

   G Em

   Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know

   G G# A

   Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold

   G B Em

   And I left his dead-ass layin' by the side of the road.

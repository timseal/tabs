   Without You-Nilsson

   E

   Well I can't forget this evening

   C#m

   Or your face as you were leaving

   A G#

   But I guess that's just the way the story goes

   C#m Cm7 A

   You always smile, but in your heart your sorrow shows

   E B

   Yes it shows

   E

   Well, I can't forget tomorrow

   C#m

   When I think of all my sorrow

   A G#

   I had you there, but then I let you go

   C#m Cm7 A

   And now it's only fair that I should let you know

   E B

   What you should know

   E

   I can't live

   C#m

   If livin' is without you

   A

   I can't give

   B

   I can't give any more

   E

   I can't live

   C#m

   If livin' is without you

   A

   I can't give

   B

   I can't give any more

   E

   Well I can't forget this evening

   C#m

   Or your face as you were leaving

   A G#

   But I guess that's just the way the story goes

   C#m Cm7 A

   You always smile, but in your heart your sorrow shows

   E B

   Yes it shows

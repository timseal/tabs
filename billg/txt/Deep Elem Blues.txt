   Once I Had A Girlfriend,

   She Meant The World To Me

   She Went Down To Deep Elem,

   Now She Ain't What She Used To Be

   Once I Knew A Preacher,

   Preached The Bible Through And Through

   He went down to Deep Elem,

   Now His Preaching Days Are Through

   When You Go Down To Deep Elem

   To Have A Little Fun,

   Have Your Ten Dollars Ready

   When The Police Man Comes

   When you go down to Deep Elem

   Put your money in your pants

   Cause the women in Deep Elem

   They don't give a man a chance

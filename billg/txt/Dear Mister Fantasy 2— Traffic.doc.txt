   A G

   Dear Mister Fantasy, play us a tune,

   D A lick

   Something to make us all happy.

   A G

   Do anything, take us out of this gloom,

   D A lick

   Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.

   You are the one who can make us all laugh,

   D A lick

   But doing that, you break out in tears.

   A G

   Please don't be sad, if it was a straight life you had,

   D A

   We never would have known you all these years.

   AIN'T MISBEHAVIN' (Fats Waller)

   F7 C7

   No one to talk to, all by myself

   F7 A7 Bb7 Bbm7

   No one to walk with, I'm happy on the shelf

   F7 Ab7 G7 C7 F7 G7 C7

   Ain't misbehavin, I'm saving my love for you

   F7 C7

   Now it's for certain, the one I love

   F7 A7 Bb7 Bbm7

   I through with flirtin' it's just you I'm thinkin' of

   F7 Ab7 G7 C7 F7 A7

   Ain't misbehavin, I'm saving my love for you

   Dm7 Bb7

   Like Jack Horner, in the corner

   G7 D7

   Don't go no where, what do I care

   G7 C7 G7 D7 G7 C7

   Your kisses are worth waiting for

   D7 G7 C7

   Be-lieve me

   F7 C7

   I don't stay out late, don't care to go

   F7 A7 Bb7 Bbm7

   I'm home about eight, just me and my radio

   F7 Ab7 G7 C7 F7 C7 F7 C7 F7

   Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

   All Along the Watchtower--Dylan

   Am G F G

   Am G F G

   "There must be some kinda way out of here"

   Am G F G

   Said the joker to the thief

   Am G F G

   "There's too much confusion,

   Am G F G

   I can't get no relief

   Am G F G

   Businessmen, they drink my wine,

   Am G F G

   Plow men dig my earth

   Am G F G

   None of them along the line

   Am G F G

   Know what any of it is worth"

   "No reason to get excited"

   The thief he kindly spoke

   "There are many here among

   Us who feel that life is but a joke

   But, you and I, we've been through that

   And this is not our fate

   So let us not talk falsely now,

   Because the hour is getting late"

   All along the watchtower

   Princes kept their view

   While other women came and went

   Barefoot servants, too

   Outside in the cold distance

   A wild cat did growl

   Two riders were approaching

   And the wind began to howl.

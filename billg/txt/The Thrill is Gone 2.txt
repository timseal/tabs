   Song: THE THRILL IS GONE

   1.

   Gm

   Thrill is gone

   Thrill is gone away

   Cm

   Thrill is gone baby

   Gm

   Thrill is gone away

   Ebmaj7 D7

   You know you done me wrong

   Gm

   You'll be sorry some day

   2.

   Gm

   Thrill is gone

   The thrill is gone away from me

   Cm

   Thrill is gone

   Gm

   The thrill is gone away from me

   Ebmaj7 D7

   Oh I'll still live on baby

   Gm

   But so lonely I'll be

   3.

   Gm

   Thrill is gone

   Thrill is gone for good

   Cm

   Oh the thrill is gone baby

   Gm

   It's gone away for good

   Ebmaj7 D7

   Some day I know I'll be open
   baby

   Gm

   Like I know I should

   4.

   Gm

   I'm free now baby

   I'm free from your spell

   Cm

   Free, free, free, now baby

   Gm

   Baby I'm free from your spell

   Ebmaj7 D7

   Now that its all over

   Gm

   All I can do is wish you well

   5.

   Gm

   Thrill is gone

   Thrill is gone away for good

   Em

   Thrill is gone baby

   Gm

   Thrill is gone away for good

   Ebmaj7 D7

   Know you done me wrong baby

   Gm

   You'll be sorry some day

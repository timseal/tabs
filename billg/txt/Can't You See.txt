   I'm gonna take a freight train, down at the station, I don't care where it
   goes

   Gonna climb me a mountain, the highest mountain, Lord,

   Gonna jump off, nobody gonna know

   Can't you see, can't you see, what that woman, she been doin' to me

   Can't you see, can't you see, what that woman been doin' to me

   I'm gonna find me a hole in the wall,

   gonna crawl inside and die

   That lady, mean ol' woman Lord,

   done told me goodbye

   Can't you see, can't you see, what that woman she been doin' to me

   Can't you see, can't you see, what that woman been doin' to me

   Gonna buy me a ticket now, as far as I can,

   ain't never comin' back

   Take me Southbound, all the way to Gerogia now, till the train run out of
   track

   Can't you see, can't you see, what that woman, she been doin' to me

   Can't you see, can't you see, what that woman been doin' to me

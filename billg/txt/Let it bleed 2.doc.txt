   Let it Bleed--Stones

   C F

   We all need someone we can lean on

   G C

   And if you want to, you can lean on me

   F

   We all need someone we can lean on

   G C

   And if you want to, you can lean on me

   C E   F

   She said my breasts, they will always be open

   G C

   You can rest your weary head right on me  E F

   And there will always be a space in my parking lot

   G C

   When you need a little coke and sympathy

   C F

   We all need someone we can cream on

   G C

   And if you want to, you can cream on me

   F

   We all need someone we can dream on

   G C

   And if you want to, you can dream on me

   E    F

   I was dreaming of a steel guitar arrangement

   G  C

   Thats when she took my health and sent it Jasmine Tea

   E F

   And then she knifed me in my dirty filthy basement

   G C 

   With that jaded, faded, junky nurse(Oh what pleasant company)

   C  F

   We all need someone we can bleed on

   G C

   And if you want to, you can bleed on me

   C  F   G

   Take my arms, take my legs, oh baby don't you take my head

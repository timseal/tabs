   Mama Tried (Haggard)

   D A7 D

   D G

   The first thing I remember knowin'

   D G

   Was a lonesome whistle blowin'

   D G A7

   And the youngins dream of growin' up to ride

   D G

   On a freight train leavin' town,

   D G

   Not knowin' where I's bound

   D A7 D

   No-one could steer me right, but Mama tried

   D G

   When an only rebel child

   D G

   From a family meek and mild

   D G A7

   Mama seemed to know what lay in store

   D G

   Despite all my Sunday learnin',

   D G

   Toward the bad, I kept on turnin'

   D A7 D

   Til Mama couldn't hold me any more

   [Chorus]

   D

   And I turned twenty-one in prison,

   C D

   Doin' life without parole

   Bm 

   No-one could steer me right,

   A

   but Mama tried, Mama tried

   D

   Mama tried to raise me better,

   G D

   But her pleading I denied

   A7

   And that leaves only me to blame,

   D

   cause Mama tried.

   D G

   Dear old daddy, rest his soul,

   D G

   Left my mom a heavy load,

   D G A7

   She tried so very hard to fill his shoes.

   D G

   Workin' hours without rest,

   D G

   She wanted me to have the best.

   D A7 D

   She tried to raise me right, but I refused.

   [Chorus]

   D

   And I turned twenty-one in prison,

   C D

   Doin' life without parole

   Bm

   No-one could steer me right,

   A

   but Mama tried, Mama tried

   D

   Mama tried to raise me better,

   G D

   But her pleading I denied

   A7 And that leaves only me to blame,

   D

   cause Mama tried.

   C G Am7 D7 G

   Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did, I've got what I paid for
   now

   C G A9 D7

   See you tomorrow, hey Frank, can I borrow a couple of bucks from you

   G Am7 G C

   To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,

   G Am7 D7

   You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

   C G

   I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley

   Am7 D7 G

   And I'm tired of all these soldiers here

   C G A9 D7

   No one speaks English, and everything's broken, and my Stacys are soaking
   wet

   G Am7 G C

   To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,

   G Am7 D7

   You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

   C G

   Now the dogs are barking and the taxicab's parking

   Am7 D7 G

   A lot they can do for me

   C G

   I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open,

   A9 D7

   And I'm down on my knees tonight

   C G

   Old Bushmill's I staggered, you'd bury the dagger

   A9 D7

   In your silhouette window light go

   G Am7 G C

   To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,

   G Am7 D7

   You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

   C G

   Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her

   Am7 D7 G

   And the one-armed bandit knows

   C G

   And the maverick Chinamen, and the cold-blooded signs,

   A9 D7

   And the girls down by the strip-tease shows,

   G Am7 G C

   Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,

   G Am7 D7

   You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

   C G

   No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say

   Am7 D7 G

   That the streets aren't for dreaming now

   C G

   And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories,

   A9 D7

   They want a piece of the action anyhow

   G Am7 G C

   Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,

   G Am7 D7

   You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

   C G

   And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor,

   Am7 D7 G

   And the old men in wheelchairs know

   C G

   And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred,

   A9 D7

   And she follows wherever you may go

   G Am7 G C

   Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,

   G Am7 D7

   You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

   C G

   And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace,

   Am7 D7 G

   And a wound that will never heal

   C G

   No prima donna, the perfume is on an

   Am7 G Am7 G7

   Old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey

   C G

   And goodnight to the street sweepers, the night watchmen flame keepers

   Am7 D7 G

   And goodnight to Mathilda, too

   Am7 G C G Am7 D7 G

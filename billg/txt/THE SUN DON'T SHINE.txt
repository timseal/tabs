   IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE - THE BAND

   G C D

   [1]

   C G G G/F# Em

   Well it makes no difference where I turn

   Em Am

   I just can't get over you when the flames still burn

   C G G G/F# Em

   And it makes no difference, night or day

   Em Am7 D

   The shadows never seem to fade away

   Chorus

   G C D G C G

   And the sun dont shine anymore

   G C D G C G

   And the rains fall down round my door

   [2]

   Bm Em

   Well these old love letters, I just can't keep

   C Am7 D

   Just like the gambler says, "Read 'em and weep"

   G C D G C G

   And the dawn don't rescue me any more

   [1]

   C G G G/F# Em

   And it makes no difference how far I go

   Em Am

   Like a scar the pain will always show

   C G G G/F# Em

   And it makes no difference who I meet

   Em Am7 D

   Its just a face in the crowd on a dead-end street

   Chorus

   G C D G C G

   And the sun dont shine anymore

   G C D G C G

   And the rains fall down round my door

   [3]

   D Em

   Without your love, I have nothing at all

   C Am7

   Like an empty hall, it's a lonely fall

   D Em

   Since you've been gone, it's a losing battle

   C Am7 D Dsus2 D

   Stampeding cattle they rattle the wa-a--all

   Chorus

   G C D G C G

   And the sun dont shine anymore

   G C D G C G

   And the rains fall down round my door

   [2]

   Bm Em

   Well I love you so much, that it's all I can do

   C Am7 D

   Just to keep myself from telling you

   G CD G C G

   That I never felt so alone before

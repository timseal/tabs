   MAMA TOLD ME NOT TO COME -- Randy Newman

   G7

   Will you have whisky with your water or sugar with your tea?

   What are these crazy questions that you're asking me?

   This is the wildest party that there ever could be

   E9 Eb9 D9 G

   Oh, don't turn on the lights cause I don't want to see

   CHORUS

   G7 C Eb G

   Mama told me not to come

   G7 C Eb

   Mama told me not to come

   G7 C Eb G [Am Bbm Bm D7 Am7 D7+5 D7] play single note run?

   Mama said "that ain't no way to have fun"

   G7

   Open up the window, let some air into this room

   I think I'm almost choking on the smell of stale perfume

   And the cigarette you're smoking 'bout to scare me half to death

   E9 Eb9 D9 G

   Oh, open up the window, let me catch my breath

   [Inst over Chorus chords]

   G7

   The radio is blastin, someone's knockin on the door

   The hostess is not lastin, she's passed out on the floor

   I've seen so many things that I ain't never seen before

   D7+5 D7 G

   I don't know what it is but I don't wanna see no more

   [Chorus]

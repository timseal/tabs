   No Doubt

   Underneath It All

   intro E\C#m

   E C#m

   There's times where I want something more

   E C#m

   Someone more like me

   E C#m

   There's times when this dress rehearsal

   Seems incomplete

   A G#m A F#m

   But, you see the colors in me like no one else

   A G#m A

   And behind your dark glasses you're...

   B

   You're something else

   [Chorus:]

   E A B

   You're really lovely

   A

   Underneath it all

   E A B

   You want to love me

   A

   Underneath it all

   E A B

   I'm really lucky

   A

   Underneath it all

   E A B

   You're really lovely

   You know some real bad tricks

   And you need some discipline

   But, lately you've been trying real hard

   And giving me your best

   And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep

   That I've ever had

   And when it's really bad

   I guess it's not that bad

   [Repeat Chorus]

   I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART

   ---4--4--4--4----------

   ---5--5--5--5----------

   ---6--6--6--6----------

   ---6--6--6--6----------

   So many moons that we have seen

   Stumbling back next to me

   I've seen right through and underneath

   And you make me better

   I've seen right through and underneath

   And you make me better

   Better... better...

   SAME AS CHORUS

   [Lady Saw:]

   For real, cuz underneath it all

   You are my real prince charming

   Like the heat from the fire

   you were always burning

   Anytime you're around

   My body keeps staling

   for your touch your kisses and your sweet romancin'

   Theres anotha side a you weh dis here woman a adore

   aside from your temper everything else secure

   you're good for me baby

   Oh that, I'm sure

   Cuz over and over again

   I want more

   [Gwen:]

   You've used up all your coupons

   And all you've got left is me

   And somehow I'm full of forgiveness

   I guess it's meant to be

   [Repeat Chorus]

   You're really lovely

   Underneath it all

   You want to love me

   Underneath it all

   I'm really lovely

   Underneath it all

   And you're really lovely

   Midnight Moonlight (Peter Rowan)

   A E

   If you ever feel lonesome, and you're down in San Antone,

   Bm E D G

   Beg, steal, or borrow two nickels or a dime, and call me on the phone.

   A E

   I'll meet you at Alamo Mission, and we can say our prayers.

   Bm E D G

   The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will heal us, as we kneel there.

   (Chorus)

   G-D G-D G D A

   In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight moonlight

   A E

   If you ever feel sorrow, for the deeds you have done

   Bm E D G

   No hope for tomorrow, in the setting of the sun

   A E

   And the ocean is howling of things that might have been

   Bm E D G

   And that last good morning sunrise will be the brightest you've ever seen.

   (Chorus)

   G-D G-D G D A

   In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight moonlight

   (Short Bridge)

   D/Dmaj7/b A D/Dmaj7/b A

   A E

   If you ever feel sorrow, for the deeds you have done

   Bm E D G

   No hope for tomorrow, in the setting of the sun

   A E

   And the ocean is howling of things that might have been

   Bm E D G

   And that last good morning sunrise will be the brightest you've ever seen.

   (Chorus)

   G-D G-D G D A

   In the moonlight, in the midnight, in the moonlight, midnight moonlight

   SUMMERTIME ( FROM PORGY AND BESS )

   Am (riff*) Bm Am

   Summertime, and the livin' is easy

   D C E ( F E )

   Fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high

   Am (riff*) Bm Am

   Yo' daddy's rich, and yo' mamma's good lookin'

   G Am C D Am ( riff*)

   So hush, little baby, don't you cry

   One of these mornings, you're gonna wake up singin'

   You'll spread your wings, and you'll take to the sky

   But until that mornin', there ain't nothin' gonna harm you

   Your mommy and daddy, sta-andin' by.

   Repeat verse 1

   * Riff

   For a 'swingier' version, play: Am Bm C Bm ( x 2 ),

   instead of the Am and Bm on lines 1 and 3.

   Also play the E...F....E at the end of line 2.

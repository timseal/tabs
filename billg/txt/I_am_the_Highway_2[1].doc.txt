   I am the Highway by Chris Cornell & Audioslave

   C G D Em

   v.1 Pearls and swine bereft of me.

   Long and weary my road has been.

   I was lost in the cities, alone in the hills.

   No sorrow or pity for leaving I feel.

   G D Am Em

   I am not your rolling wheels, I am the Highway.

   G D Am B Em

   I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky.

   C G D Em

   v.2 Friends and liars don't wait for me.

   I'll get on all by myself.

   I put millions of miles under my heels.

   And still too close to you I feel.

   G D Am Em

   I am not your rolling wheels, I am the Highway.

   I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky.

   I am not your blowing wind, I am the lightning.

   G D Am B Em

   I am not your autumn moon, I am the night.

   Instrumental break, then Repeat long Refrain

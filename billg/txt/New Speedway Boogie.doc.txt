   New Speedway Boogie (in memory of Altamont)

   Am C G Am

   Please don't dominate the rap Jack, if you got nothin' new to say.

   Am C G Am

   And if you please, don't back up the tracks, this train's got to run
   today.

   Am C G Am

   I spent a little time on the mountain, spent a little time on the hill.

   Am C G D

   Like some say, better run away; others say you better stand still.

   Am C G Am

   Now I don't know but I been told that it's hard to run with the weight of
   gold

   Am C G D Am

   On the other hand, I've heard it said, it's just as hard with the weight
   of lead

   Am C G Am

   Who can deny, who can deny, it's not just a change of style.

   Am C G Am

   One step done and another begun, and I wonder how many miles.

   Am C G Am

   I spent a little time on the mountain, spent a little time on the hill,

   Am C G Am

   I saw things getting out of hand but I guess they always will.

   Am C G Am

   Well, I don't know, but I've been told in the heat of the sun a man died
   of cold

   Am C G D

   Keep on comin' or stand and wait with the sun so dark and the hour so
   late.

   Am C G Am

   You can't overlook the lack, Jack, of any other highway to ride,

   Am C G Am

   It's got no signs or dividing lines, and very few rules to guide.

   Am C G Am

   Now I don't know but I've been told if the horse don't pull you got to
   carry the load.

   Am C G D

   I don't know whose back`s that strong; maybe find out before too long.

   Am C G Am

   One way or another, one way or another, this darkness has got to give.

   Am C G Am

   One way or another, one way or another, this darkness has got to give.

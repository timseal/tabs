   [Verse 1]

   Em C

   There's a girl who lives on Heaven Hill.

   Em C

   (continue Em & C for rest of verse)

   I go up to her cabin still.

   She keeps a lantern lit for me.

   And a bottle up on her mantlepiece

   Em

   [Chorus]

   G D

   She's the girl who lives on Heaven Hill

   Em C

   G D

   She's the girl who lives on Heaven Hill

   [Play Riff A]

   [Verse 2]

   She's got a big room and it's always a mess

   Worn out shoes and a worn out dress

   A worn out smile that she'll wear some more

   And a worn out welcome mat by the door

   [Chorus]

   [Play Riff A]

   [Solo (not tabbed here)]

   [Chorus]

   [Play Riff A]

   [Verse 3]

   I'd trade big mountains and rooms full of gold

   For just one look at the beauty of this woman's soul

   Up on Heaven Hill is where I want to be

   That girl, that bottle, that matress and me

   [Chorus]

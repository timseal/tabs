   But roll, roll around heaven all day

   Fuss with my woman toil for my kids

   Lift me up to Paradise

   Show me that river, take me across

   And wash all my troubles away.

   Like That Lucky Old Sun, give me nothin' to do

   But roll, roll around heaven all day

   Show me that river

   Lead me across and wash all my troubles away.

   Like That Luck-y Old Sun, give me nothin' to do

   But roll, roll around heaven

   Roll, roll around heaven

   I want to roll around heaven all day

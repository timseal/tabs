   Sopranos Theme F#m, B

   You woke up this morning
   Got yourself a gun,
   Mama always said you'd be
   The Chosen One.

   She said: You're one in a million
   You've got to burn to shine,
   But you were born under a bad sign,
   With a blue moon in your eyes.

   You woke up this morning
   All the love has gone,
   Your Papa never told you
   About right and wrong.

   But you're looking good, baby,
   I believe you're feeling fine, (shame about it),
   Born under a bad sign
   With a blue moon in your eyes.

   You woke up this morning
   The world turned upside down,
   Thing's ain't been the same
   Since the Blues walked into town.

   But you're one in a million
   You've got that shotgun shine.
   Born under a bad sign,
   With a blue moon in your eyes.

   When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.
   By half past ten your head was going ding-dong.
   Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
   like a voice telling you there was something you should know.
   Last night you were flying but today you're so low
   - ain't it times like these that make you wonder ifyou'll ever know
   the meaning of things as they appear to the others;
   wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers.
   Don't you wish you didn't function, wish you didn't think
   beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink'
   Well you do so make up your mind to go on, 'cos
   when you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.

   When you woke up this morning,
   When you woke up this morning,
   When you woke up this morning,
   Mama said you'd be the Chosen One.

   When you woke up this morning,
   When you woke up this morning,
   When you woke up this morning,
   You got yourself a gun.

   SWEET JANE- The Velvet Underground

   D A G Bm A D A G Bm A

   Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand

   Jack is in his coat, and Jane is her vest, and me

   I'm in a rock'n'roll band Hah!

   Ridin' in a Stutz-Bearcat, Jim

   Y'know, those were different times!

   Oh, all the poets they studied rules of verse

   And the ladies, they rolled their eyes

   Sweet Jane! Whoa! Sweet Jane, oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!

   I'll tell you something

   Jack, he is a banker

   And Jane, she is a clerk

   Both of them save their monies, ha

   And when, when they come home from work

   Sittin' down by the fire, oh!

   The radio does play

   The classical music there, Jim

   "The March of the Wooden Soldiers"

   All you protest kids

   You can hear Jack say, get ready, ah

   Sweet Jane! Come on baby! Sweet Jane! Oh-oh-a! Sweet Jane!

   Some people, they like to go out dancing

   And other peoples, they have to work, Just watch me now!

   And there's even some evil mothers

   Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt

   Y'know that, women, never really faint

   And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!

   And that, y'know, children are the only ones who blush!

   And that, life is just to die!

   And, everyone who ever had a heart

   They wouldn't turn around and break it

   And anyone who ever played a part

   Oh wouldn't turn around and hate it!

   Sweet Jane! Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane!

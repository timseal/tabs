   Runaway

   Am

   As I walk along

   G

   I wonder what went wrong

   F

   With our love

   E Esus4 E

   A love that was so strong

   Am

   And as I still walk on

   G

   I think of the things we done

   F

   Together,

   E Esus4 E

   While our hearts were young

   A

   I'm a walkin' in the rain

   F#m

   Tears are fallin' and I feel a pain

   A

   Wishin' you were here by me

   F#m

   To end this misery

   A

   And I wonder

   F#m

   I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder

   A

   Why

   F#m

   Why-why-why-why-why she ran away

   D E

   And I wonder where she will stay

   A

   My little runaway

   D A E

   Run-run-run-run-runaway

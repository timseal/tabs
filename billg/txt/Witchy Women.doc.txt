   Gm D7 Gm

   Raven hair and ruby lips, Sparks fly from her finger tips,

   D7 Gm

   Echoed voices in the night, She's a restless spriit on and endless flight

   Gm D7 Gm

   Woo-hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies

   Gm D7 Gm

   Woo-hoo witchy woman, she got the moon in her eyes

   Gm D7 Gm

   She had me spell-bound in the night. Dancing shadows in the fire light

   D7

   Crazy laughter in another room,

   Gm

   And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon.

   Gm D7 Gm

   Woo-hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies

   Gm

   I know you want to love her, but let me tell you brother,

   Cm Bb Gm

   She's been sleepin in the devil's bed.

   Gm

   There's some rumors goin round. Someone's underground,

   Bb C Gm

   She can rock you in the night until your skin turns red

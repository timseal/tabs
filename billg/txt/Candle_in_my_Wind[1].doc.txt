   Candle In The Wind Music by Elton John Lyrics by Bernie Taupin

   Available on the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road

   VERSE

   E A

   Goodbye Norma Jean Though I never knew you at all, You had the grace to

   E A

   hold yourself While those around you crawled. They crawled out of the

   E A

   woodwork And they whispered into your brain They set you on the

   E A

   treadmill And they made you change your name. And it

   CHORUS

   B E A

   seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never

   E B A

   knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would have liked to
   have known

   C#m B

   you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your

   A E... B7 A E B7

   legend ever did. (repeat last line instrumentally w lead gtr melody)

   VERSE 2

   (E) Loneliness was tough, The toughest role (A) you ever played; Hollywood
   created a (E) superstar, And pain was the price you paid. (A) Even when
   you

   (E) died Oh the (A) press still hounded you. All the papers (E) had to say

   Was that Marilyn was found (A) in the nude. CHORUS: And it...

   VERSE 3

   (E) Goodbye Norma Jean Though I never (A) knew you at all, You had the
   grace to

   (E) hold yourself While those around you crawled. (A)

   (E) Goodbye Norma Jean From the young man in the (A) 22nd row Who sees you
   as something (E) more than sexual More than just our Mari- (A) -lyn
   Monroe.

   CHORUS: And it...

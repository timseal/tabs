   Sam Stone

   by John Prine

   G

   Sam Stone came home,

   C

   To the wife and family

   D G

   After serving in the conflict overseas.

   G

   And the time that he served,

   C

   Had shattered all his nerves,

   D G

   And left a little shrapnel in his knees.

   Em

   But the morphine eased the pain,

   Em

   And the grass grew round his brain,

   A D D7

   And gave him all the confidence he lacked,

   A D D7

   With a purple heart and a monkey on his back.

   CHORUS:

   G C

   There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money

   goes,

   D G

   Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.

   G

   Little pitchers have big ears,

   C

   Don't stop to count the years,

   D D C D7

   Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.

   hmmmm hmmmm

   G C

   Sam Stone's welcome home didn't last too long.

   D G

   He went to work when he'd spent his last dime

   G

   And Sammy took to stealing

   C

   When he got that empty feeling

   D G

   For a hundred dollar habit without overtime.

   Em

   And the gold roared through his veins

   Em

   Like a thousand railroad trains,

   A D D7

   And eased his mind in the hours that he chose,

   A

   While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples'

   D D7

   clothes...

   CHORUS:

   G C

   There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money

   goes,

   D G

   Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.

   G

   Little pitchers have big ears,

   C

   Don't stop to count the years,

   D D C D7

   Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.

   hmmmm hmmmm

   G

   Sam Stone was alone

   C

   When he popped his last balloon,

   D G

   Climbing walls while sitting in a chair.

   G

   Well, he played his last request,

   C

   While the room smelled just like death,

   D G

   With an overdose hovering in the air.

   Em

   But life had lost it's fun,

   Em

   There was nothing to be done,

   A D

   But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill,

   A D D7

   For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill.

   CHORUS:

   G C

   There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money

   goes............

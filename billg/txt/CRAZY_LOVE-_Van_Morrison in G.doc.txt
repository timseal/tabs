   CRAZY LOVE - Van Morrison

   G Bmin

   I can feel her heartbeat

   C G

   from a thousand miles

   G Bmin

   And the heavens open

   C G

   every time she smiles

   G Bmin

   And when I come to her

   C G

   that's where I belong

   G Bmin

   Yeah, I'm running to her

   C G

   like a river's song

   CHORUS:

   G D Emin D C D

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   G D Emin D C G

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   G Bmin

   She's got a fine sense of humor

   C G

   when I'm feeling low down

   G Bmin

   And when I come to her

   C G

   when the sun goes down

   G Bmin

   She take away my trouble

   C G

   take away my grief

   G Bmin

   Take away my heartache,

   C G

   I go right to sleep

   CHORUS:

   G D Emin D C D

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   G D Emin D C G

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   BRIDGE

   D C G

   Yes I need her in the daytime

   D C G

   Yes I need her in the night

   D C G Bm

   Yes I want to throw my arms around her

   D C G D

   Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

   G Bmin

   And when I'm returning

   C G

   from so far away

   G Bmin

   She gives me some sweet lovin

   C G

   brightens up my day

   G Bmin

   Yes it makes me righteous,

   C G

   yes it makes me whole

   G Bmin

   Yes it makes me mellow

   C G

   down into my soul

   CHORUS:

   G D Emin D C D

   G D Emin D C G

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   G D Emin D C D

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   G D Emin D C G

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

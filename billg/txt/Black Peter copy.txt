   Black Peter -- Grateful Dead (Hunter, Garcia)

   A7 D7 A7 D7

   All of my friends come to see me last night, I was layin' in my bed and
   dyin'.

   Em Bm A G F#m Em D7

   Annie Bonneau from St. Angel say the weather down here so fine.

   A7 D7 A7 D7

   Just then the wind came squallin' through the door, But who can the
   weather command?

   Em Bm A G F#m Em D7

   Just want to have a little peace to die, and a friend or two I love at
   hand.

   A7 D7 A7 D7

   Fever rolled up to a hundred and five, Roll on up, gonna roll back down.

   Em Bm A G F#m Em D7

   One more day I find myself alive, tomorrow maybe cold beneath the ground.

   [Chorus]

   C Em

   See here how everything lead up to this day,

   Dm Am Em

   And it's just like any other day that's ever been.

   D G C Em Am

   Sun comin' up and then the sun goin' down.

   F C D Dm F A7

   Shine through my window and my friends they come around, Come around, come
   around.

   A7 D7 A7 D7

   The people might know, but the people don't care, That a man can be as
   poor as me.

   Em Bm A G F#m Em D7

   Take a look at poor Peter, he's lying in pain, now let's go run and see,
   run and

   A7

   see...go run and see...

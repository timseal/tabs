   The Kinks: Apeman

   -----------------

   D D D D D A E D E A

   A A

   I think I'm sophisticated 'cause I'm living my life

   E E

   like a good homo sapiens

   A A

   But all around me everybody's multiplying and

   E E

   they're walking round like flies man

   D D

   So I'm no better than the animals sitting

   A A

   in the cages in the zoo man

   A A

   Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees

   D E A

   I am an apeman.

   I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized

   'cause I'm a strict vegetarian

   But with the over-population and inflation and starvation

   and the crazy politicians

   I don't feel safe in this world no more,

   I don't want to die in a nuclear war.

   I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman.

   I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman

   I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodo man, oh I'm an apeman

   Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky,

   Compared to the clouds as they roll by,

   Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies I am an apeman.

   In man's evolution he's created the city

   and the motor traffic rumble.

   But give me half a chance and I'd be taking off my clothes

   and living in the jungle.

   Cause the only time that I feel at ease

   Is swinging up and down in the coconut trees.

   Oh what a life of luxury to be like an apeman.

   I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman

   I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodo man, oh I'm an apeman

   I look out the window but I can't see the sky,

   The air pollution is a-fucking up my eyes,

   I want to get out of this city alive and make like an apeman.

   Oh come on and love me, be my apeman girl

   And we'll be so happy in my apeman world.

   I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman

   I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodo man, oh I'm an apeman

   I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane,

   I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane,

   We'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day, just like an apeman.

   I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman

   I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodo man, oh I'm an apeman

   I don't feel safe in this world no more,

   I don't want to die in a nuclear war.

   I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman.

   UP ON CRIPPLE CREEK THE BAND

   A D7

   When I get offa this mountain, you know where I wanna go

   A D E

   Straight down the Mississippi river to the Gulf of Mexico

   A A7 D D7

   To Lake Charles Lousiana, that little Bessie girl I once knew

   A D E

   She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

   Chorus

   A

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   D

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   E

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   F#m G

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   A D7

   Good luck had just stung me, To the racetrack I did go

   A D E

   She bet on one horse to win, and I bet on another to show

   A A7 D D7

   The odds were in my favor, I had `em 5 to 1

   A D E

   That nag to win came around the track, sure enough we had won

   Chorus

   A

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   D

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   E

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   F#m G

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   A D7

   I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half

   A D E

   She tore it up and threw it in my face, `a just for a laugh

   A A7 D D7

   Now there's one thing in the whole wide world I sure would like to see

   A D E

   That's when that little love of mine dips her donut in my tea

   Chorus

   A

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   D

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   E

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   F#m G

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   A D7

   Well me and my mate were back at the shack,we had Spike Jones on the box

   A D E

   She said I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk

   A A7 D D7

   Now that just gave my heart a throb to the bottom of my feet

   A D E

   And I swore as I took another pour, my Bessie can't be beat

   Chorus

   A

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   D

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   E

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   F#m G

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   A D

   Lo lo lo ooo

   A D

   Lo-de-lo-de-lo-ooo

   A D7

   There's a burnout in California and up north it's freezing cold

   A D E

   And this livin' offa the road is gettin' pretty old

   A A7 D D7

   So I guess I'll call up my big Mamma, and tell her I'll be rollin' in

   A D E

   But you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted to go and see Bessie again

   Chorus

   A

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   D

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   E

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   F#m G

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   Feelin Alright} {st:Dave Mason}

   [A7] [D7(or D9)] [A7] [D7]

   [A7]Seems I got to have a [D7]change of scene

   [A7]Cause every night I have the [D7] strangest dreams

   [A7]Imprisoned by the way it [D7]used to be

   [A7]Left here on my own or [D7]so it seems

   [A7]I got to leave before I [D7]start to scream

   [A7]But someone's locked the door and [D7]took the key

   Feelin' [A7]alright [D7] not feelin' too [A7]good myself [D7]

   Feelin' [A7]alright [D7] not feelin' too [A7]good myself [D7]

   [A7]Boy you sure took me for [D7]one big ride

   [A7]Even now I sit and [D7]wonder why

   [A7]And when I think of you I [D7]start to cry

   [A7]Got to stop belivin' in [D7]all your lies

   [A7]Cause I got to much to do be[D7]fore I die

   [A7]Don't get too lost in [D7]all I say

   [A7]If half the time I really [D7]felt that way

   [A7]That was then and now [D7]it's today

   [A7]Can't get off yet and so I'm [D7]here to stay

   [A7]Before someone comes along and [D7]takes my place

   [A7]With a different name and yes a [D7]different face

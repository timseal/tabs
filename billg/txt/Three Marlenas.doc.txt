   Three Marlenas-Wallflowers

   The whole song follows this progression...

   [G, D, Am/Am, D, G]

   G D Am

   Alone tonight in somebody's bed

   Am D G

   She gone and dyed her hair red

   G  D Am

   She only went and did what she did

   Am D G

   'Cause he would drive her home then

   G D Am

   There's lipstick on her new dress

   Am D  G

   She hadn't even paid yet

   G D Am

   But it doesn't matter where the money went

   Am D G

   It wasn't how she paid 'er rent

   G  D  Am G

   One, two, three Marlenas

   G D Am

   There's got to be someone we can trust

   Am D G

   Out here among us

   [Verse two]

   Now lookin' out across the city lights

   She thought they'd be a good pair

   Now he could make a living sellin' cars

   Maybe she could work there

   She's gonna pick a star in the night

   And pray to make it all right

   She tried so hard not to pick a kite

   She always prayed to heaven lights

   G D Am G

   One, two, three Marlenas

   G D Am

   There's got to be someone we can trust

   Am D G

   Out here among us

   G D Am G

   One, two, three Marlenas

   G D Am D G

   It's see no, speak no, hear no evil about us

   G D Am

   The three Marlenas

   [Verse three]

   Man, I think I'm gonna buy myself a Rolls

   Maybe a Chevrolet

   One where I can pull that top down

   Just let my radio play

   Now I'm headin' out on that highway

   I'm goin' right out of state

   Now I ain't lookin' back until I'm gone

   Right through heaven's gates

   G D Am G

   One, two, three Marlenas

   G D Am

   There's got to be someone we can trust

   Am D G

   Out here among us

   G D Am G

   One, two, three Marlenas

   G D Am D G

   It's see no, speak no, hear no evil about us

   G D Am

   The three Marlenas

   ANGEL FROM MONTGOMERY

   C F C F

   I am an old man named after my father.

   C F G F

   My old lady's another child that's grown old.

   C F C F

   If dreams were thunder and lightning was desire

   C F G C

   this old house would've burnt down a long time ago

   CHORUS

   C Bb F C

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   C Bb F C

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   C Bb F C

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   C Bb F C

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   C F C F

   When I was a young man I had me a cowgirl,

   C F G F

   wa'n't much to look at, just a free ramblin' child.

   C F C F

   But that was a long time, and no matter how I try,

   C F G C

   the years just flow by like a broken-down dam.

   CHORUS

   C Bb F C

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   C Bb F C

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   C Bb F C

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   C Bb F C

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   C F C F

   There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear all their buzzin'

   C F G F

   but I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today.

   C F C F

   How can a person goes to work in the morning

   C F G C

   come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say.

   CHORUS

   C Bb F C

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   C Bb F C

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   C Bb F C

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   C Bb F C

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

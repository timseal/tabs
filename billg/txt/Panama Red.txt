   Panama Red, Panama Red, he'll steal your woman, then he'll rob your head

   Bm A

   Panama Red, Panama Red,

   F# G

   On his white horse, Mescalito, He'll come breezin' through town.

   A D

   I'll bet your woman's up in bed with, Panama Red.

   (Verse)

   D G

   The judge don't know when Red's in town, he keeps well hidden underground.

   A D

   But everybody's acting lazy, falling out and hangin' `round

   G

   My woman said "Hey, Pedro, you're actin' crazy like a clown"

   A D

   Nobody feels like workin' Panama Red is back in town.

   (Chorus)

   Bm A G E7 A

   Panama Red, Panama Red, he'll steal your woman, then he'll rob your head

   Panama Red, Panama Red,

   F# G

   On his white horse, Mescalito, He'll come breezin' through town.

   A D

   I'll bet your woman's up in bed with, Panama Red.

   D G

   Everybody's lookin' out for him, `Cause they know Red satisfies

   A D

   Little girls love to listen to him sing and tell sweet lies

   G

   But when things get too confusin,' honey, you're better off in bed

   A D

   And I'll be searchin' all the joints in town for Panama Red

   (Chorus)

   Bm A G E7 A

   Panama Red, Panama Red, he'll steal your woman, then he'll rob your head

   Bm A

   Panama Red, Panama Red,

   F# G

   On his white horse, Mescalito, He'll come breezin' through town.

   A D

   I'll bet your woman's up in bed with, Panama Red.

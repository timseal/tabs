   PARADISE by John Prine

   C F C

   When I was a child my family would travel

   C G C

   Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born

   C F C

   And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered

   C G C

   So many times that my memories are worn.

   C F C

   And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County

   C G C

   Down by the Green River where Paradise lay

   C F C

   Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

   C G C

   Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

   Well sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River

   To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill

   Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols

   But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.

   And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County

   Down by the Green River where Paradise lay

   Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

   Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

   Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel

   And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land

   Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken

   Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man.

   And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County

   Down by the Green River where Paradise lay

   Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

   Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

   When I die let my ashes float down the Green River

   Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam

   I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waiting

   Just five miles away from wherever I am.

   And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County

   Down by the Green River where Paradise lay

   Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

   Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

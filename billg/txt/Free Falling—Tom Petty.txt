   And it's a long day, livin' in Reseda. There's a freeway runnin' through
   the yard.

   A D D A E A D D A E

   And I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her, I'm a bad boy for breakin'
   her heart.

   (chorus)

   A D D A E A D D A E

   And I'm free free fallin'

   A D D A E A D D A E

   Yeah, I'm free, free fallin'

   A D D A E A D D A E

   And all the vampires walkin' through the valley move west down Ventura
   Boulevard.

   A D D A E A D D A E

   And all the bad boys are standin' in the shadows, and the good girls are
   home with broken hearts.

   (chorus)

   A D D A E A D D A E

   And I'm free free fallin'

   A D D A E A D D A E

   Yeah, I'm free, free fallin'

   A D D A E A D D A E

   I wanna glide down over Mulholland I wanna write her name in the sky.

   A D D A E A D D A E

   I'm gonna free fall out into nothin', gonna leave this world for a while

   (chorus)

   A D D A E A D D A E

   And I'm free free fallin'

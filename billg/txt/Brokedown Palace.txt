   Going to leave this brokedown palace,

   F Dm Bb F

   On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll.

   In my time, In my time, I will roll, roll roll.

   In a bed, in a bed,

   Bb F G

   By the waterside I will lay my head.

   Going to plant a weeping willow,

   F Dm Bb F

   On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.

   A C#m D A

   You can take all the tea in China

   C#m D E

   Put it in a big brown bag for me.

   A C#m D A

   Sail right round all the seven oceans,

   A C#m D A

   Drop it straight into the deep blue sea.

   [Chorus:]

   A C#m D A

   She's as sweet as tupelo honey,

   A C#m D E

   She's an angel of the first degree

   A C#m D A

   She's as sweet as tupelo honey,

   A C#m D A

   Just like honey baby, from the bee.

   A C#m D A

   You can't stop us on the road to freedom,

   C#m D E

   You can't keep us `cause our eyes can see.

   A C#m D A

   Men with insight, men in granite,

   A C#m D A

   Knights in armor bent on chivalry.

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   Bm

   Preacher man don't tell me: heaven is under the Earth

   I know you don't know what life is really worth

   It's not all that glitters that's gold, half the story has never been told

   Bm F#7

   So now you see the light, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   You see, most people think great God will come from the sky

   Take away everything, and make everybody feel high

   But if you know what life is really worth, you will look for yours on
   Earth

   And now you see the light, stand up for your right, jah

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   We're sick and tired of your ism and skism game,

   die and go to heaven in Jesus' name

   We know when we understand that the son of God is a living man

   You can fool some of the people some of the time,

   but you can't fool all the people all the time

   And now we see the light, we're gonna stand up for our right

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

   Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

   Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight

   Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight

   Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight

   Don't give up the fight, don't give up the fight

   So, we won't give up the fight

   So, we won't give up the fight

   So, we won't give up the fight

   So, we won't give up the fight

   So, we won't give up the fight

   Stand up for your right

   Stand up for your right

   Stand up for your right...

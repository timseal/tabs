   DO IT AGAIN STEELY DAN

   Am Am7 |

   In the mornin' you go gunnin' for the man who stole your water

   Am Am7

   And you fire 'til he's done in, but they catch you at the border

   Am Am7 |

   And the mourners are all singin' as they drag you by your feet

   Am Am7 |

   But the hangman isn't hangin' and they put you on the street

   Dm7 Em7 F Em7 Am

   Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again Wheels turnin' round and round

   Dm7 Em7 F Em7 Am

   You go back, Jack, do it again...

   Am Am7 |

   Well you know she's no high climber, then you find your only friend

   Am Am7 |

   In a room with your two timer, but you're sure you're near the end

   Am Am7 |

   Then you love a little wild one, and she brings you only sorrow

   Am Am7 |

   All the time you know she's smilin', you'll be on your knees tomorrow

   Dm7 Em7 F Em7 Am

   Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again Wheels turnin' round and round

   Dm7 Em7 F Em7 Am

   You go back, Jack, do it again...

   Am Am7 |

   Now you swear and kick and beg us that you're not a gamblin' man

   Am Am7 |

   Then you find you're back in Vegas with a handle in your hand

   Am Am7 |

   Your black cards can make you money so you hide them when you're able

   Am Am7 |

   In the land of milk and honey you must put them on the table

   Dm7 Em7 F Em7 Am

   Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again Wheels turnin' round and round

   Dm7 Em7 F Em7 Am

   You go back, Jack, do it again...

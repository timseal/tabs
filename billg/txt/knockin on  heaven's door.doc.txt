   Ma take this badge off of me

   G D C

   And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door

   G D Am7

   Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

   G D Am7

   Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

   G D Am7

   Mama, wipe the blood from my face

   G D C

   I'm sick and tired of the war

   G D Am7

   Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

   G D Am7

   Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door

   G D Am7

   Ma take these guns from me

   G D C

   I just can't shoot them anymore

   G D Am7

   There's a long black cloud a-followin' me

   G D C

   And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door

   And it types to a waiting world

   ?But the field's so shocked by this world is rocked?

   Now the playing's stopped in the playground now

   She wants to play with her toys a while

   And schools out early and soon we'll be learning

   And then bull horn crackles and the captain tackles

   With the problems in the house of life

   And they can see no reasons, cause there are no reasons

   What reasons do you need to die,oh,oh,oh,oh

   And the silicon chip inside her head

   Gets switched to overload

   And nobody's gonna go to school today

   She's gonna make them stay at home

   And daddy doesn't understand it,

   He always said she was good as gold

   And he can see no reasons, cause there are no reasons

   What reasons do you need to be show-o-o-o-own

   (Tell me why!) I don't like Mondays

   (Tell me why!) I don't like Mondays

   (Tell me why!) I don't like Mondays

   I wanna shooo-ooo-oot the whole day down

   Desperados under the eaves

   Warren Zevon

   F Bb C F

   I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel

   Bb C F

   I was staring in my empty coffee cup

   A Asus4-A Bb

   I was thinking that the gypsy wasn't lyin'

   F (let ring)

   All the salty margaritas . . .

   C

   I'm gonna drink 'em up

   F Bb C(III) F

   And if California slides into the ocean

   Bb C(I) F

   Like the mystics and statistics say it will

   A Asus4(?) Bb

   I predict this motel will be standing

   C F Bb F C

   Until I pay my bill

   Bb C F

   Don't the sun look angry through the trees

   Bb C F

   Don't the trees look like crucified thieves

   Dm Gm

   Don't you feel like Desperados under the eaves

   Bb C F

   Heaven help the one who leaves

   Bb F

   Still waking up in the mornings with shaking hands

   F C

   And I'm trying to find a girl who understands me

   A Asus4 Bb

   But except in dreams you're never really free

   Bb C F

   Don't the sun look angry at me

   F Bb C F

   I was sitting in the Hollywood Hawaiian Hotel

   Bb C F

   I was listening to the air conditioner hum

   Dm F F/C Bb F C

   It went mmmmmm..

   Dm F F/C Bb F C

   (Look away down Gower Avenue, Look away....)

   Look away...

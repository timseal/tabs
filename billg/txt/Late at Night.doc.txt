   Late at Night-The Subdudes

   Early in the morning, I'm just tryin' to live it down

   Late at night, I do just like I please

   Early in the morning, I get down upon my knees

   Late at night, I held the truth in my hand just like a little shiny jewel

   Early in the morning, I look in the mirror and see the same old fool

   I'm praying Lord, you got to help me now

   Lord, you got to help me now  I'm praying Lord, you got to help me now

   Lord, you got to help me now

   Late at night, all my neighbors come to call

   Early in the morning, I hear them banging on the wall

   Late at night, I blow in like a hurricane

   Early in the morning, I'm just a steady steady rain

   Late at night, I'm a ripping and a roaring enough to wake the dead

   Early in the morning, I can barely find the strength to raise my aching
   head

   I'm praying Lord, you got to help me now

   Lord, you got to help me now  I'm praying lord, you got to help me now

   Lord, you got to help me now

   Late at night

   C D G C

   Old and in the way, that's what I heard them say

   Am C G

   They used to heed the words he said, but that was yesterday

   C D G C

   Gold will turn to gray and youth will fade away

   Am C G

   They'll never care about you while you're old and in the way

   D G

   Once I hear tell, he was happy

   C G D

   Had his share of friends and good times

   C

   Now, those friends have all passed on

   G Em

   He don't have no place called home

   Am C D G

   Like the old dog gone astray, he's just old and in the way

   When just a boy, he left his home

   Thought he'd have the world on a string

   Now the years have come and gone

   Through the streets he walks alone

   Lookin' back to a better day, feelin' old and in the way

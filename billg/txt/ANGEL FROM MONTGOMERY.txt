   ANGEL FROM MONTGOMERY

   E A E A

   I am an old man named after my father.

   E A D E

   My old lady's another child that's grown old.

   E A E A

   If dreams were thunder and lightning was desire

   E A D E

   this old house would've burnt down a long time ago

   CHORUS

   E D A E

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   E D A E

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   E D A E

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   E D A E

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   E A E A

   When I was a young man I had me a cowgirl,

   E A D E

   wa'n't much to look at, just a free ramblin' child.

   E A E A

   But that was a long time, and no matter how I try,

   E A D E

   the years just flow by like a broken-down dam.

   CHORUS

   E D A E

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   E D A E

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   E D A E

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   E D A E

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   E A E A

   There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear all their buzzin'

   E A D E

   but I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today.

   E A E A

   How can a person goes to work in the morning

   E A D E

   come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say.

   CHORUS

   E D A E

   Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.

   E D A E

   Make me a poster of an old rodeo.

   E D A E

   Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.

   E D A E

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   E D A E

   To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.

   Catfish John Jerry Garcia Band

   C Thing (x3) (G)(A)(B)

   C F

   Mama said, don't go near that river

   C G (G)(A)(B)

   Don't be hangin' around old Catfish John

   C F

   Come the morning I'd always be there

   C G C (C)(Bb)(A)

   Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

   F C (C)(Bb)(A)

   Take me back to another lifetime

   F C (C)(Bb)(A)

   To a time so long ago

   F C

   Where the sweet magnolia blossomed

   G C (C)(Bb)(A)

   Cotton fields as white as snow

   Catfish John was a river hobo

   Lived and died by the river bed

   Lord in heaven, I still remember

   I was proud to be his friend

   Mama said, don't go near that river

   Don't be hangin' around old Catfish John

   Come the morning I'd always be there

   Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

   *Solo* verse (repeat)

   Mama said, don't go near that river

   Don't be hangin' around old Catfish John

   Come the morning I'd always be there

   Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

   Born a slave in the land of dixie

   Traded for a chestnut mare

   Lord, he never spoke in anger

   Though his load was hard to bear

   Mama said, don't go near that river

   Don't be hangin' around old Catfish John

   Come the morning I'd always be there

   Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn

   Walkin' in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn...

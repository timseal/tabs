   COCAINE by J. J. Cale

   (the main riff is [E] [E] [D] [E], [E] [D] -- play that twice over each

   line of the verses)

   If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out, cocaine.

   If you wanna get down, down on the ground, cocaine.

   She don't [E] lie, she don't [D] lie, she don't [C] lie [B]

   Cocaine!

   If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues, cocaine.

   When your day is done and you wanna run, cocaine.

   Chorus

   If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on, cocaine.

   Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back, cocaine.

   Chorus

   (long solo here?)

   Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

   Trying to make a living and doing the best I can

   But when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand

   That I was born a ramblin' man

   My father was a gambler down in Georgia

   C D

   And he wound up on the wrong end of a gun

   C G Em C

   And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus

   G D G

   Rolling down highway forty-one

   Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

   Trying to make a living and doing the best I can

   But when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand

   That I was born a ramblin' man

   *Solo* (intro & verse)

   I'm on my way to New Orleans this morning

   Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee

   They're always having a good time down on the Bayou, Lord

   Them delta women think the world of me.

   Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

   Trying to make a living and doing the best I can

   But when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand

   That I was born a ramblin' man

   Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

   Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

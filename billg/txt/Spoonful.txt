   Spoonful

   (Dixon)

   G/E ad nausium-but interesting with melodic leads and slides

   Could have been a spoonful of coffee

   Could have been a spoonful of tea

   Just a little spoon of your precious love is good enough for me

   Man lies about that, man cries about that

   Man dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

   Could have been a spoonful of water

   Spread out on the desert sand

   Just a little spoon of this forty-five, save you from another man

   Man lies about that, man cries about that

   Even dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

   Could have been a spoonful of diamonds

   Could have been a spoonful of gold

   Just a little spoon of your precious love to satisfy my soul

   Everybody's talking about spoonful

   Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

   Everybody's fighting about spoonful

   Eyes Of the World -- Grateful Dead (Hunter, Garcia)

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   Right outside this lazy summer home

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no.

   A C#m B A

   Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home,

   C#m B D A

   Wonderin' w here the nut thatch winters, wings a mile long

   E A E A C

   Just carried the bird away.

   (chorus)

   G C G C

   Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.

   G C G C

   The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.

   D C G C

   Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings.

   G C D Bm A Emaj7

   The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own.

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   There comes a redeemer and he slowly too fades away.

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   There follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay.

   A C#m B A

   The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay,

   E A E A C

   Night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day.

   (chorus)

   G C G C

   Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.

   G C G C

   The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.

   D C G C

   Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings.

   G C D Bm A Emaj7

   The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own.

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   Sometimes we live no particular way but our own.

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home.

   A C#m B A

   Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone,

   E A E A C

   Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own.

   (chorus)

   G C G C

   Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.

   G C G C

   The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.

   D C G C

   Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings.

   G C D Bm A Emaj7

   The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own.

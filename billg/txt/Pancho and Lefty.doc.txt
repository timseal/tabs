   Pancho and Lefty

   (Townes Van Zandt)

   D

   Livin' on the road, my friend

   A

   Was gonna keep us free and clean

   G

   But now you wear your skin like iron

   D A

   And your breath's as hard as kerosene

   G

   You weren't your mama's only boy

   D G

   But her favorite one, it seems

   Bm

   She began to cry

   G A

   When you said good bye (pause)

   G Bm

   And sank into your dreams

   D

   Pancho was a bandit, boys

   A

   His horse was fast as polished steel

   G

   He wore his guns outside his pants

   D A

   For all the honest world to feel

   G

   Pancho met his match, you know

   D G

   On the deserts down in Mexico

   Bm G A

   No one heard his dyin' words (pause)

   G Bm

   But that's the way it goes

   G

   And all the federales say

   D G

   They could have had him any day

   Bm G A

   They only let him Hang around (pause)

   G Bm

   Out of kindness, I suppose

   D

   Now Lefty he can't sing the blues

   A

   All night long like he used to

   G

   The dust that Pancho bit down South

   D A

   It ended up in Lefty's mouth

   G

   The day they laid old Pancho low

   D G

   Lefty split for Ohio

   Bm G A

   Where he got the bread to go (pause)

   G Bm

   Well there ain't nobody 'knows

   G

   And all the federales say

   D G

   They could have had him any day

   Bm G A

   They only let him slip away (pause)

   G Bm

   Out of kindness, I suppose

   D

   Now poets sing how Pancho fell

   A

   Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel

   G

   The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold

   D A

   And so the story ends, we're told

   G

   Pancho needs your prayers, it's true

   D G

   But say a few for Lefty, too

   Bm G A

   He only did what he had to do (pause)

   G Bm

   And now he's growin' old

   G

   A few Gray federales say

   D G

   They could have had him any day

   Bm G A

   They only let him slip away (pause)

   G Bm

   Out of kindness, I suppose

   G

   A few old federales say

   D G

   They could have had him any day

   Bm G A

   They only let him slip away (pause)

   G Bm

   Out of kindness, I suppose

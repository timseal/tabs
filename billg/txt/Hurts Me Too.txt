   It Hurts Me Too

   A7

   You said you was hurtin',

   A7

   Almost lost your mind;

   D7

   'Cause the man you love,

   D7

   Hurts you all the time.

   A7

   But when things go wrong,

   E7-Eb7--D7 (run)

   Wrong with you

   D7 A7 -D7-A7- E7 (run)

   It hurts me too.

   A7

   You love him a little more,

   A7

   When you ought to love him less.

   D7

   Why pick up behind him

   D7

   And take his best?

   A7

   `Cause when things go wrong,

   E7-Eb7-D7 (run)

   Wrong with you

   D7 A7-D7-A7-E7 (run)

   It hurts me too.

   A7

   You love another man;

   A7

   Oh, but I love you

   D7

   But you love him darlin',

   D7

   Stick to him just about like glue.

   A7

   But when things go wrong,

   E7-Eb7--D7 (run)

   Wrong with you

   D7 A7 -D7-A7- E7 (run)

   It hurts me too.

   A7

   Well, he better leave you,

   A7

   Or you best put him down.

   D7

   Cause you know, I just can't stand

   D7

   To see, see you'all pushed around

   A7

   `Cause when things go wrong,

   E7-Eb7-D7 (run)

   Wrong with you

   D7 A7-D7-A7-E7 (run)

   It hurts me too.

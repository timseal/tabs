   AIN'T NO SUNSHINE

   Bill Withers

   Am Em G Am

   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

   Em G Am

   It's not warm when she's away.

   Dm C

   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long,

   Am Em Am

   anytime she goes away.

   Am Em G Am

   Wonder this time where she's gone.

   Am Em G Am

   Wonder if she's gone to stay.

   Dm C

   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home,

   Am Em Am

   anytime she goes away.

   Am

   Acapella

   And I know, I know, I know, I know,

   I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

   I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

   I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

   I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

   I know, I know...

   Hey, I oughta leave young thing alone,

   Am Em G Am

   but ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

   Am Em G Am

   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.

   Am Em G Am

   Only darkness everyday.

   Dm C Am

   Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home,

   Em G Am

   anytime she goes away.

   Am Em G Am

   anytime she goes away.

   Am Em G Am

   anytime she goes away.

   High Time -- Grateful Dead (Hunter, Garcia)

   D C#m Ab Gb

   You told me goodbye, how was I to know

   A E D A B

   You didn't mean goodbye, you meant ple-ase don't let me go.

   B E B A E D A E

   I was having a high time, living the good li-ii-fe, well I know.

   D C#m Ab Gb

   The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay.

   A E D A

   Now listen here baby, 'cause I mean what I say.

   B E B A E D A E

   I was having a high time, living the good li-ii-fe, well I know.

   [Chorus]

   F E

   I was losing time, I had nothing to do,

   B C#m F#m E

   No one to fight, I came to you.

   F E

   Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw,

   B C#m F#m E (Esus4 D A?)

   The line is busted, the last one I saw.

   D C#m Ab Gb

   Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain,

   A E D A B

   Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying.

   B E B A E D A E

   I could show you a high time, living the good li-ii-fe,, don't be that
   way.

   D C#m Ab Gb

   Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong,

   A E D A B

   Come in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone.

   B E B A E D A E

   We could have us a high time, living the good li-ii-fe,, don't be that
   way.

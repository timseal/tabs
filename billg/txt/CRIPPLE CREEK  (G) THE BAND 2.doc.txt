   UP ON CRIPPLE CREEK THE BAND

   G C7

   When I get offa this mountain, you know where I wanna go

   G C D

   Straight down the Mississippi river to the Gulf of Mexico

   G G7 C C7

   To Lake Charles Lousiana, that little Bessie girl I once knew

   G C D

   She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

   Chorus

   G

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   C

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   D

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   Em F

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   G C7

   Good luck had just stung me, To the racetrack I did go

   G C D

   She bet on one horse to win, and I bet on another to show

   G G C C7

   The odds were in my favor, I had `em 5 to 1

   G C D

   That nag to win came around the track, sure enough we had won

   Chorus

   G

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   C

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   D

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   Em F

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   G C7

   I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half

   G C D

   She tore it up and threw it in my face, `a just for a laugh

   G G7 C C7

   Now there's one thing in the whole wide world I sure would like to see

   G C D

   That's when that little love of mine dips her donut in my tea

   Chorus

   G

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   C

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   D

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   Em F

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   G C7

   Well me and my mate were back at the shack,we had Spike Jones on the box

   G C D

   She said I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk

   G G7 C C7

   Now that just gave my heart a throb to the bottom of my feet

   G C D

   And I swore as I took another pour, my Bessie can't be beat

   Chorus

   G

   Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me

   C

   If I spring a leak, she mends me

   D

   I don't have to speak, she defends me

   Em F

   A drunkard's dream, if I ever did see one

   G C

   Lo lo lo ooo

   G C

   Lo-de-lo-de-lo-ooo

   G C7

   There's a burnout in California and up north it's freezing cold

   G C D

   And this livin' offa the road is gettin' pretty old

   G G7 C C7

   So I guess I'll call up my big Mamma, and tell her I'll be rollin' in

   G C D

   But you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted to go and see Bessie again

   Chorus-------------out

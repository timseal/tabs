   G

   Well the first days are the hardest days,

   C G

   Don't you worry any more,

   G

   'Cause when life looks like Easy Street,

   C G

   There is danger at your door.

   Am Em

   Think this through with me,

   C D

   Let me know your mind,

   C D G Am G

   Wo, oh, what I want to know,

   D G

   Is are you kind?

   It's a buck dancer's choice my friend;

   Better take my advice.

   You know all the rules by now

   And the fire from the ice.

   Will you come with me?

   Won't you come with me?

   Wo, oh, what I want to know,

   Will you come with me?

   G C

   Goddamn, well I declare,

   Am G D

   Have you seen the like?

   C

   Their walls are built of cannonballs,

   G D C D

   Their motto is "Don't tread on me".

   G C Am G D

   Come hear Uncle John's Band playing to the tide,

   C

   Come with me, or go alone,

   G D C D

   He's come to take his children home.

   G D* (or Bm) C D G D*(or Bm) C D

   It's the same story the crow told me;

   It's the only one he knows.

   Like the morning sun you come

   And like the wind you go.

   Ain't no time to hate,

   Barely time to wait,

   Wo, oh, what I want to know,

   Where does the time go?

   I live in a silver mine

   And I call it Beggar's Tomb;

   I got me a violin

   And I beg you call the tune,

   Anybody's choice,

   I can hear your voice.

   Wo, oh, what I want to know,

   How does the song go?

   G C Am G D

   Come hear Uncle John's Band by the riverside,

   C

   Got some things to talk about,

   G D C D

   Here beside the rising tide.

   G C Am G D

   Come hear Uncle John's Band playing to the tide,

   C

   Come on along, or go alone,

   G D C D

   He's come to take his children home.

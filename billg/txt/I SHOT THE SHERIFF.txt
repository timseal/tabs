   I SHOT THE SHERIFF (Bob Marley)

   ==================

   Em

   I shot the sheriff,

   Am Em

   but I did not shoot the deputy.

   Em

   I shot the sheriff,

   Am Em

   but I did not shoot the deputy.

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   All around in my home town

   Cmaj7 Bm7n Em

   they're trying to track me down.

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   They say they want to bring me in guilty

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   for the killing of a deputy,

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   for the killing of a deputy.

   But I say:

   Em

   I shot the sheriff,

   Am Em

   but I swear it was in self defence.

   Em

   Sheriff John Brown always hated me

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   for what I don't know.

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   Ev'ry time that I plant a seed

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   he said "Kill it before it grow,"

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   he said "Kill it before it grow."

   Freedom came my way one day

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   and I started out of town.

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown,

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   aiming to shoot me down.

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   So I shot, I shot him down.

   But I say: riff

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   Reflexes got the better of me

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   and what is to be must be.

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   Ev'ry day the bucket goes to the well,

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   but one day the bottom will drop out,

   Cmaj7 Bm7 Em

   yes one day the bottom will drop out.

   But I say: riff

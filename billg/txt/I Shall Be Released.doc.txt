   I Shall Be Released (Dylan)

   A Bm

   They say ev'rything can be replaced,

   C#m D E A

   Yet ev'ry distance is not near.

   A Bm

   So I remember ev'ry face

   C#m D E A

   Of ev'ry man who put me here.

   A Bm

   I see my light come shining

   C#m D E A

   From the west unto the east.

   A Bm

   Any day now, any day now,

   C#m D E A

   I shall be released.

   A Bm

   They say ev'ry man needs protection,

   C#m D E A

   They say ev'ry man must fall.

   A Bm

   Yet I swear I see my reflection

   C#m D E A

   Some place so high above this wall.

   A Bm

   I see my light come shining

   C#m D E A

   From the west unto the east.

   A Bm

   Any day now, any day now,

   C#m D E A

   I shall be released.

   A Bm

   Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,

   C#m D E A

   Is a man who swears he's not to blame.

   A Bm

   All day long I hear him shout so loud,

   C#m D E A

   Crying out that he was framed.

   A Bm

   I see my light come shining

   C#m D E A

   From the west unto the east.

   A Bm

   Any day now, any day now,

   C#m D E A

   I shall be released.

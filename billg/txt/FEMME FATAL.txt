   FEMME FATALE

   Velvet Underground

   Cmaj7 Fmaj7

   Here she comes

   Cmaj7 Fmaj7

   You better watch your step

   Cmaj7 F Dm G

   She's gonna break your heart in two, yes it's true

   Cmaj7 Fmaj7

   It's not hard to realize

   Cmaj7 Fmaj7

   Just look into her false colored eyes

   Cmaj7 F Dm G

   She'll bring you up just to put you down, what a clown

   CHORUS

   C F

   Cos everybody knows (she's a femme fatale)

   C F

   The things she does to please (she's a femme fatale)

   C F

   She's just a little tease (she's a femme fatale)

   Dm Bb G

   Just see the way she walks and hear the way she talks

   You're written in her book

   Number 47 have a look

   She's going to play you for a fool, it's true

   The voices in the street

   Before you start you're already beat

   She's going to smile just to make you frown, what a clown

   CHORUS

   CHORUS

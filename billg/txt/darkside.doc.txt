   Em7 A Asus4 A

   Breathe, breathe in the air.

   Em(add9) Em7 A Asus4 A

   Don't be afraid to care.

   Em(add9) A Asus4 A

   Leave but don't leave me.

   Em(add9) Asus4 A

   Look around and choose your own ground.

   Cmaj7

   For long you live and high you fly

   Bm7

   And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry

   Fmaj7

   All you touch and all you see

   G D7#9 B7b9

   Is all your life will ever be.

   Em7 A A7sus4 A7

   Run, rabbit run.

   Em A A7sus4 A

   Dig that hole, forget the sun,

   Em7 A A7sus4 A7

   When at last the work is done

   Em7 A Asus4 A

   Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

   Cmaj7

   For long you live and high you fly

   Bm7

   But only if you ride the tide

   Fmaj7

   And balanced on the biggest wave

   G D7#9 D7b9 Em [Segue to "On the Run]

   You race towards an early grave.

   Time

   Words and Music by Roger Waters, Nicholas Mason, David Gilmour and Rick
   Wright

   [With clocks, alarms, and bells for approximately 40 seconds]

   N.C.(E) (F#m) (E) (F#m) (E) (F#m) (E) (F#m) (A) (E) (F#m)

   F#m A Asus4 A

   Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day

   E F#m

   Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.

   A

   Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town

   E F#m

   Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

   Dmaj7 Amaj7

   Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.

   Dmaj7 Amaj7

   You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.

   Dmaj7 C#m7

   And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.

   Bm7 E F5

   No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

   [Guitar solo]

   F#m A E F#m A F#m A E F#m A E F#m

   Dmaj7 Amaj7 Dmaj7 Amaj7 Dmaj7 C#m7 Bm7 E

   F#m A

   And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking

   E F#m

   Racing around to come up behind you again.

   A A7 A7sus4 A7

   The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,

   E F#m

   Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

   Dmaj7 Amaj7

   Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

   Dmaj7 Amaj7

   Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines

   Dmaj7 C#m

   Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way

   Bm

   The time is gone, the song is over,

   Bm7 F/B

   Thought I'd something more to say.

   Em(add9) A A7 A7sus4 A7 Em(add9) A A7

   Em7 Em A Asus4 A

   Home, home again.

   Em7 A A7

   I like to be here when I can.

   Em(add9) A D A/D

   When I come home cold and tired

   G/D E5 G5 A Asus4 A

   It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.

   Cmaj7

   Far away across the field

   Bm7

   The tolling of the iron bell

   Fmaj7

   Calls the faithful to their knees

   G D7#9 D7b9/Eb Bm

   To hear the softly spoken magic spell.

   Money

   -----

   Words and Music by Roger Waters

   Bm7

   Money, get away.

   Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.

   Money, it's a gas.

   Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.

   F#m7

   New car, caviar, four star daydream,

   Em Bm7

   Think I'll buy me a football team.

   Bm7

   Money, get back.

   I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.

   Money, it's a hit.

   Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.

   F#m7 Em

   I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set

   Bm7

   And I think I need a Lear jet.

   Bm7

   Money, it's a crime.

   Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.

   Money, so they say

   Is the root of all evil today.

   F#m7 Em

   But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're

   Bm

   giving none away.

   Us And Them

   Words by Roger Waters

   Music by Roger Waters & Rick Wright

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7) G/D Dsus2

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7) G/D Dsus2

   Dsus Esus2/D Dm(maj7)

   Us, and them

   G/D D (A/D) (D) A/D

   And after all we're only ordinary men.

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7)

   Me, and you.

   G/D D A/C#

   God only knows it's not what we would choose to do.

   Bm

   Forward he cried from the rear

   Bm/A D/G C

   and the front rank died.

   Bm A

   The general sat and the lines on the map

   D/G C

   moved from side to side.

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7)

   Black and blue

   G/D Dsus2

   And who knows which is which and who is who.

   Esus2/D Dm(maj7)

   Up and down.

   G/D D A/D A/C#

   And in the end it's only round and round and round.

   Bm

   "Haven't you heard? It's a battle of words"

   Bm/A D/G C

   the poster bearer cried.

   Bm

   "Listen son", said the man with the gun

   Bm/A D/G C

   "There's room for you inside."

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7) G/D A/D

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7) G/D Dsus2

   Bm Bm/A D/G C Bm A Bm Bm/A G C

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7)

   Down and out

   G/D D

   It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about.

   Dsus2 Esus2/D Dm(maj7)

   With, without.

   G/D D

   And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

   Bm

   Out of the way, it's a busy day

   Bm/A D/G C

   I've got things on my mind.

   Bm

   For the want of the price of tea and a slice

   Bm/A D/G C

   The old man died.

   Brain Damage

   ------------

   Words and Music by Roger Waters

   D G7/D

   The lunatic is on the grass.

   D G7/D

   The lunatic is on the grass.

   D E/D

   Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.

   A7 D Dsus2

   Got to keep the loonies on the path.

   D G7/D

   The lunatic is in the hall.

   D G7/D

   The lunatics are in my hall.

   D E/D

   The paper holds their folded faces to the floor

   A7 D Dsus2 D7 D9

   And every day the paper boy brings more.

   G A

   And if the dam breaks open many years too soon

   C G

   And if there is no room upon the hill

   G A7

   And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too

   C G Bm7 Em7 A A7

   I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

   D G7/D

   The lunatic is in my head. (laughter)

   D G7/D

   The lunatic is in my head

   D E/D

   You raise the blade, you make the change

   A7 D Dsus2

   You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.

   D

   You lock the door

   E/D

   And throw away the key

   A7 D Dsus2 D7 D9

   There's someone in my head but it's not me.

   G A

   And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear

   C G

   You shout and no one seems to hear.

   A A7 A

   And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes

   C G Bm7 Em A7

   I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

   All that is gone

   Bbmaj7 Bbmaj7b5

   A7 D

   and everything under the sun is in tune

   D/C Bbmaj7 Bbmaj7b5 D

   but the sun is eclipsed by the moon. [with heartbeat effects]

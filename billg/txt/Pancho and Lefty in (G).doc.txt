   Pancho and Lefty

   (Townes Van Zandt)

   G

   Livin' on the road, my friend

   D

   Was gonna keep us free and clean

   C

   But now you wear your skin like iron

   G D

   And your breath's as hard as kerosene

   C

   You weren't your mama's only boy

   G C

   But her favorite one, it seems

   Em

   She began to cry

   C D

   When you said good bye (pause)

   C Em

   And sank into your dreams

   G

   Pancho was a bandit, boys

   D

   His horse was fast as polished steel

   C

   He wore his guns outside his pants

   G D

   For all the honest world to feel

   C

   Pancho met his match, you know

   G C

   On the deserts down in Mexico

   Em C D

   No one heard his dyin' words (pause)

   C Em

   But that's the way it goes

   C

   And all the federales say

   G C

   They could have had him any day

   Em C D

   They only let him Hang around (pause)

   C Em

   Out of kindness, I suppose

   G

   Now Lefty he can't sing the blues

   D

   All night long like he used to

   C

   The dust that Pancho bit down South

   G D

   It ended up in Lefty's mouth

   C

   The day they laid old Pancho low

   G C

   Lefty split for Ohio

   Em C D

   Where he got the bread to go (pause)

   C Em

   Well there ain't nobody 'knows

   C

   And all the federales say

   G C

   They could have had him any day

   Em C D

   They only let him Hang around (pause)

   C Em

   Out of kindness, I suppose

   G

   Now poets sing how Pancho fell

   D

   Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel

   C

   The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold

   G D

   And so the story ends, we're told

   C

   Pancho needs your prayers, it's true

   G C

   But say a few for Lefty, too

   Em C D

   He only did what he had to do (pause)

   C Em

   And now he's growin' old

   C

   A few grey federales say

   G C

   They could have had him any day

   Em C D

   They only let him Hang around (pause)

   C Em

   Out of kindness, I suppose

   C

   A few grey federales say

   G C

   They could have had him any day

   Em C D

   They only let him Hang around (pause)

   C Em

   Out of kindness, I suppose

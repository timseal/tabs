   White Dove

   Old & In The Way

   (Stanley)

   [Intro: E B E]

   E E7 A

   In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia

   E B

   There's a place I love so well

   E E7 A

   Where I spent many days of my childhood

   E B E

   In the cabin where we loved to dwell

   [Chorus]

   White Dove will mourn in sorrow

   The willow will hang their head

   I live my life in sorrow

   Since mother and daddy are dead

   We were all so happy there together

   In our peaceful little country home

   But the savior needs angels up in heaven

   Now they sing around the great White Dove

   [Chorus]

   [Instrumental]

   As the years roll by I often wonder

   Will we all meet together someday

   And each night as I wander through the graveyard

   Darkness finds me where I kneel to pray

   [Chorus]

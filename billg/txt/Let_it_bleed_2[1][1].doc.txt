   She said my breasts, they will always be open

   D  G

   You can rest your weary head right on me B  C

   I was dreaming of a steel guitar arrangement

   D  G

   Thats when she took my health and sent it Jasmine Tea

   And then she knifed me in my dirty filthy basement

   We all need someone we can bleed on

   D  G

   And if you want to, you can bleed on me

   Take my arms, take my legs, oh baby don't you take my head

   Take me to the river

   E7 D A

   E7 D A

   I don't know why I love you like I do

   E7 D A

   After all the changes you put me through

   E7 D A

   You took my money and my cigarettes

   E7 D A

   Now I ain't seen hide nor hair of you yet*

   C G A G

   I wanna know, won't you tell me, why I'd love to stay...

   E7 D A

   Take me to the river,

   E7

   And wash me down

   D A E7

   Take me to the water,

   D A E7

   And put my feet back on the ground

   E7 D A

   I don't know why you treat me so bad

   E7 D A

   Think of all the things that we could have had

   E7 D A

   Love is emotion that I can't forget

   E7 D A

   My sweet sixteen I will never regret

   C#m A

   Hold me, squeeze me

   C#m A

   Love me, baby you can tease me

   G

   Til I can't, til I can't,

   G

   til I can't, I can't take no more

   E7

   Take me to the river

   E7 D A

   I don't know why I love you like I do

   E7 D A

   After all the changes you put me through

   E7 D A

   Sixteen candles burn on my wall

   E7 D A

   Tell me I'm the biggest fool of them all

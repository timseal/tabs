   "We're Gonna Make It"-Little Milton

   (B. Davis - C. Smith - R. Miner - G. Barge)

   Verse 1:

   G C

   We may not have a cent to pay the rent

   G

   But we're gonna make it, I know we will

   (G)

   We may have to eat beans every day

   D

   But we're gonna make it, I know we will

   Bm Em

   And if a job is hard to find

   Bm Em

   And we have to stand in the welfare line

   C D

   I've got your love and you know you got mine

   G

   So we're gonna make it, I know we will

   Verse 2:

   We may not have a home to call our own

   But we're gonna make it, I know we will

   We may have to fight hardships alone

   But we're gonna make it, I know we will

   'Cause togetherness brings peace of mind

   We can't stay down all the time

   I've got your love and you know you got mine

   So we're gonna make it, I know we will

   Verse 3:

   Our car may be old, our two rooms cold

   But we're gonna make it, I know we will

   We may not can spare a roach a crumb

   But we're gonna make it, I know we will

   And if I have to carry 'round a sign

   Sayin' "Help the deaf, the dumb, and the blind"

   I got your love and you know you got mine

   So we're gonna make it, I know we will

   Coda:

   We're gonna make it

   G Em

   (We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)

   We're gonna make it, baby

   G Em

   (We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)

   It might seem hard sometime

   G Em

   (We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)

   But don't worry, darlin' baby

   G Em

   (We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)

   We're gonna keep on tryin'

   G Em

   (We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it) [fade]

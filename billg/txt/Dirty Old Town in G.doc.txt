   Dirty Old Town--Ewan McColl}

   I met my [G]love by the gasworks door;

   Dreamed a [C]dream by the old ca[G]nal.

   Kissed my [Em]girl by the factory [G]wall.

   Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town.

   The moon is [G]shifting behind a cloud,

   Cats are [C]crawling all along the [G]beat,

   Springs a [Em]girl in the streets at [G]night.

   Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town.

   I heard a [G]whistle coming from the docks

   And a [C]train set the night on [G]fire,

   Smelled the [Em]spring on a smoke-filled [G]air.

   Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town.

   I'm gonna [G]get me a nice sharp axe,

   Shining [C]steel tempered in a [G]fire,

   Cut you [Em]down like an old dead [G]tree,

   Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town.

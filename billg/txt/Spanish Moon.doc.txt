   (Lowell George)

   One two
   Well the night that I got into town
   Was the night that the rain froze on the ground
   Comin' down the street I heard such a sorrowful tune
   Comin' from the place they called the Spanish Moon

   Well I stepped inside, and I stood by the door
   While dark-eyed girls sang and played the guitar
   Hookers and hustlers, filled up the room
   This was the place they called the Spanish moon

   Whiskey and bad cocaine
   Got me on ?? train
   If that don't kill me soon
   The women will down at the Spanish Moon

   Well I sold my watch and I pawned my ring
   Just to hear that girl sing
   'Bout the news my whole ?? rose soon
   'Bout the news down at the Spanish Moon

   Whiskey and bad cocaine
   Got me on ?? train
   If that don't kill me soon The women will down at the Spanish Moon
   oh oh give it

   What if I said, can you get to the end It's a ?? situation
   If that don't kill me soon
   The women will down at the Spanish Moon
   Oh oh, give it to me please, whoa

   Well I stepped inside, and I stood by the door
   A dark-eyed girl sang and played the guitar
   Hookers and hustlers, filled up the room
   This was the place they called the Spanish moon

   Whiskey and bad cocaine
   Got me on ?? train
   If that don't kill me soon
   The women will down at the Spanish Moon

   E7 A7 B7 Pink Cadillac Bruce Springsteen

   (E7)You may think I'm fooling for the foolish things I do

   You may wonder how come I love you, when you get on my nerves like

   you do

   Well (A7)baby, you know you bug me There ain't no secret about that

   Well come on (E7)over here and hug me And baby I'll spill the facts

   Well (B7)honey it ain't your money 'Cause I got plenty of that

   I love you for your

   Chorus

   (E7)Pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats

   Riding in the back, oozing down the street

   (A7)Waving to the girls, Peeling out of sight

   (E7)Spending all my money on a Saturday night

   (B7)Honey I just wonder what you do there in back of your

   (E7)Pink Cadillac, Pink Cadillac

   Well now (E7)way back in the Bible temptations always come along

   There's always sombody tempting you

   Into doing something they know is wrong

   Well they (A7)tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold

   And they (E7) tempt you with the pleasures that flesh does surely hold

   They say (B7)Eve tempted Adam with an apple

   Man I ain't going for that I know it was her

   Chorus ( Repeat)

   (E7)Pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats

   Riding in the back, oozing down the street

   (A7)Waving to the girls, Peeling out of sight

   (E7)Spending all my money on a Saturday night

   (B7)Honey I just wonder what you do there in back of your

   (E7)Pink Cadillac, Pink Cadillac

   Harp/bass lead over chorus

   (back)

   Now (E7)some folks say it's too big and uses too much gas

   Some folks say that it's too old and that it goes too fast

   But (A7)love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger than a Subaru

   Hey (E7)man there's only one thing and one car that will do

   Anyway we (B7) don't have to drive it honey

   We can park it out back and have a party in your

   (E7)Pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats

   Riding in the back, oozing down the street

   (A7)Waving to the girls, Peeling out of sight

   (E7)Spending all my money on a Saturday night

   (B7)Honey I just wonder what you do there in back of your

   (E7)Pink Cadillac, Pink Cadillac

   (E7)Pink Cadillac, Pink Cadillac

   Left a good job in the city

   Working for the man every night and day

   And I never lost one minute of sleep

   Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

   E

   The big wheel keeps on turnin',

   F#m

   Proud Mary keeps on burnin'

   A

   Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

   GG E GG E GG E D CC A C A

   A

   Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis

   Pumped a lot of pain in New Orleans

   But I never saw the good side of the city

   Till I hitched a ride on the Riverboat Queen

   E

   The big wheel keeps on turnin',

   F#m

   Proud Mary keeps on burnin'

   A

   Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

   GG E GG E GG E D CC A C A

   A

   If you come down to the river

   Bet your gonna find some people who live

   You don't have to worry, cause you have no money

   The people on the river are happy to give

   E

   The big wheel keeps on turnin',

   F#m

   Proud Mary keeps on burnin'

   A

   Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

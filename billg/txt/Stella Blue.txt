   Stella Blue

   E Emaj7 Asus A

   All the years combine They melt into a dream

   Em C7 B

   A broken angel sings from a guitar

   E Emaj7 Asus A

   In the end there's just a song Comes crying like the wind

   Em C7 B

   Through all the broken dreams and vanished years

   chorus:

   E A E

   Stella Blue Stella Blue

   E Emaj7 Asus A

   When all the cards are down There's nothing left to see

   Em C7 B

   There's just the pavement left and broken dreams

   E Emaj7 Asus A

   In the end there's still that song Comes crying like the wind

   Em C7 B

   Down every lonely street that's ever been

   E A E

   Stella Blue Stella Blue

   B E A E B

   I've stayed in every blue-light cheap ho-tel Can't win for trying

   B E A E B (A B)

   Dust off those rusty strings just one more time Gonna make 'em shine

   E Emaj7 Asus A

   It all rolls into one And nothing comes for free

   Em C7 B

   There's nothing you can hold for very long

   E Emaj7 Asus A

   And when you hear that song Come crying like the wind

   Em C7 B

   Seems like all this life was just a dream

   E A E

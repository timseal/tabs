   D(addE) D G (x2)

   G D G

   Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armour coming,

   D G

   Sayin' something about a queen.

   D A

   There where peasants singin' and drummers drummin'

   G A

   And the archer split the tree.

   Bm C

   There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun

   G C

   that was floating on the breeze.

   D A

   Look at Mother Nature on the run

   C G

   In the nineteen seventies.

   C G

   In the nineteen seventies.

   I was lying in a burned out basement

   With a full moon in my eye

   I was hoping for replacement

   When the sun burst through the sky

   There was a band playing in my head

   And I felt like getting high

   I was thinking about what a friend had said

   I was hoping it was a lie

   Thinking about what friend had said

   I was hoping it was a lie

   Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceship flying

   In the yellow haze of the sun

   There were children crying and colours flying

   All around the chosen one

   All in a dream, all in a dream

   The loading had begun

   Flying mother nature's silver seed

   To a new home in the sun

   Flying mother nature's silver seed

   To a new home

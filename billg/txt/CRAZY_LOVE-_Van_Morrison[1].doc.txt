   CRAZY LOVE - Van Morrison

   A C#min

   I can feel her heartbeat

   D A

   from a thousand miles

   A C#min

   And the heavens open

   D A

   every time she smiles

   A C#min

   And when I come to her

   D A

   that's where I belong

   A C#min

   Yeah, I'm running to her

   D A

   like a river's song

   CHORUS:

   A E F#min E D E

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   A E F#min E D A

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   A C#min

   She's got a fine sense of humor

   D A

   when I'm feeling low down

   A C#min

   And when I come to her

   D A

   when the sun goes down

   A C#min

   She take away my trouble

   D A

   take away my grief

   A C#min

   Take away my heartache,

   D A

   I go right to sleep

   CHORUS:

   A E F#min E D E

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   A E F#min E D A

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   BRIDGE

   E D A

   Yes I need her in the daytime

   E D A

   Yes I need her in the night

   E D A F#m

   Yes I want to throw my arms around her

   B  D A E

   Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

   [Instrumental over Verse/Chorus count]

   A C#min

   And when I'm returning

   D A

   from so far away

   A C#min

   She gives me some sweet lovin

   D A

   brightens up my day

   A C#min

   Yes it makes me righteous,

   D A

   yes it makes me whole

   A C#min

   Yes it makes me mellow

   D A

   down into my soul

   CHORUS:

   A E F#min E D E

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   A E F#min E D A

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   A E F#min E D E

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

   A E F#min E D A

   She gives me love love love love, crazy love

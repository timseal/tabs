   FOLSOM PRISON BLUES JOHNNY CASH

   E

   I hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,

   E E7

   And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,

   A7 E

   I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on.

   B7 E

   But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone.

   E

   When I was just a baby, my momma told me, "Son,

   E E7

   Always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns."

   A7 E

   But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.

   B7 E

   When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.

   E

   I bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car.

   E E7

   They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars,

   A7 E

   But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free,

   B7 E

   But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me.

   E

   Well if they freed me from this prison,

   E E7

   if that railroad train was mine,

   E E7

   I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line,

   A7 E

   Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay,

   B7 E

   And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.

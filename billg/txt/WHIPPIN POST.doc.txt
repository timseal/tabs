   WHIPPIN' POST (Gregg Allman)

   Am Am(on 2nd fret) A(on 5th fret) Am(on 2nd fret) Am

   I've been run down, and I've been lied to,

   And I don't know why I let that mean woman make me a fool.

   She took all my money, wrecked my new car,

   Now she's with one of my good time buddies

   Drinkin in some cross town bar

   Bm7 D7 E7
   CHORUS: Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel,
   | A D C
   | Like I've been tied to the whippin' post
   | A D C
   | Tied to the whippin' post,
   | A D C
   | Tied to the whippin' post,
   | C Tacet
   - Good lord I feel like I'm dying.

   My friends tell me that I've been such a fool,

   And I have to stand by and take if, baby, all for loving you.

   Drown myself in sorrow and I look at what you've done,

   But nothing seems to change, the bad times stay the same

   And I can't go on

   CHORUS

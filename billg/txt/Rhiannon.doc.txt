   Fleetwood Mac

   Transcribed by Andy Citron (citron@vnet.ibm.com)

   This is from a live version. It is different from the one

   that's currently on the OLGA because it has words and chords.

   Intro (repeat 2x, its basically Am F)

   Am Bm/A C/A Bm/A Am G/A Am

   G/A F G7/F F G7/F G7/F F

   Am

   Rhiannon rings like a bell thru the night

   F

   and wouldn't you love to love her?

   Am

   Takes to the sky like a bird in flight

   F

   and who will be her lover?

   C

   All your life you've never seen a

   F

   woman taken by the wind

   C

   Would you stay if she promised you heaven?

   F

   Will you ever win?

   Am

   She is like a cat in the dark

   F

   and then she is the darkness

   Am

   She rules her life like a fine skylark

   C

   All your life you've never seen a woman

   I Hear You KnockingDave Edmunds

   A - B - E - A/Bb/B

   E

   You went away and left long time ago

   Now your knocking on my door

   A

   I hear you knocking

   E

   But you can't come in

   A

   I hear you knocking

   B

   Go back where you been

   E

   I begged you not to go but you said goodbye

   Now your telling me all your lies

   A

   I hear you knocking

   E

   But you can't come in

   A

   I hear you knocking

   B

   Go back where you been

   Solo

   E

   You better get back to your used to be

   'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me

   A

   I hear you knocking

   E

   But you can't come in

   A

   I hear you knocking

   B

   Go back where you been

   E

   I told you way back in '52

   That I would never go with you

   A

   I hear you knocking

   E

   But you can't come in

   A

   I hear you knocking

   B

   Go back where you been

   End solo

   I'm waitin' for my man

   D G D G

   26 dollars in my hand

   D F# G A

   Up to Lexington, 125, feel sick and dirty more dead than alive

   I'm waitin' for my man

   Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown?

   Hey white boy, you chasin' our women around?

   Oh pardon me sir, it's furthest from my mind,

   I'm just lookin' for a dear dear friend of mine

   I'm waitin' for my man

   Here he comes all dressed in black

   Alligator Shoes and a big straw hat

   He's never early, he's always late

   First thing you learn is that you've always got to wait

   I'm waitin' for my man

   Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs

   Everybody's pinned you (?) but nobody cares

   He's got the works, here's your sweet taste

   Ah then you got to split cause you got no time to waste

   I'm waitin for my man

   Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout

   I'm feelin good, you know I'm gonna work it on out

   I'm feelin good, I feel oh so fine

   Until tomorrow, but that's just another time

   I'm waitin for my man

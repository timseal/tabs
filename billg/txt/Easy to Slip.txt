   It's so easy to slip-Lowell George

   D Dsus4

   It's so easy to slip

   D

   It's so easy to fall

   G D

   Let your memory drift and do nothin' at all

   G

   All the love that you missed

   G

   And all the people that you can't recall

   G D

   Do they really exist at all?

   D C(9) G C G

   Well, the whole world seems so cold today

   D

   And all the magic's gone away

   D C(9) G C

   And our time together melts away

   G D

   Like the sad melody I play.

   It's so easy to slip

   D

   It's so easy to fall

   G D

   Let your memory drift and do nothin' at all

   G

   All the love that you missed

   G

   And all the people that you can't recall

   G D

   Do they really exist at all?

   D C(9) G C G

   Well, I don't want to live forever

   D

   In the shadow of your leaving me

   D C(9) G C G

   So I'll light another (mellow) cigarette

   G D

   And try to remember to forget.

   There she stood in the street

   Asus4 A

   Smilin' from her head to her feet

   A Asus4 A

   I said, "Hey, what is this?

   Asus4 A

   Maybe she's in need of a kiss"

   A Asus4 A

   I said, "Hey, what's your name, baby?

   Asus4 A

   Maybe we can see things the same.

   A Asus4 A

   Now, don't you wait or hesitate

   Asus4 A

   Let's move before they raise the parkin' rate!"

   All right now, baby, it's all right now

   A G D A

   All right now, baby, it's all right now

   A Asus4 A

   I took her home to my place

   Asus4 A

   Watching every move on her face

   A Asus4 A

   She said, "Look, what's your game, baby?

   Asus4 A

   Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"

   A Asus4 A

   I said, "Slow, don't go so fast

   Asus4 A

   Don't you think that love can last?"

   A Asus4 A

   She said, "Love, Lord above,

   Asus4 A

   Now you're tryin' to trick me in love!"

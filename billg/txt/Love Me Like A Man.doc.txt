   [E] These men that I been seeing, baby Got their souls upon the shelf

   You know they can't ever love me When they can't can't even love
   themselves

   But I [A] need someone to love me Someone to really under[E]stand

   Who won't [B7] put himself above me [A] But who just loves me like a [E]
   man [B7]

   [E] I never seen such losers, darling Even though I tried to find

   A man who would take me home Instead of taking me for a ride

   I [A] need someone to love me I know you [E] can

   Be[B7]lieve when I tell you [A] You can love me like a [E] man [B7]

   break:

   A///A///E///E///

   A///A///E///E///

   B7///A///E///B7///

   chorus:

   [E] I want me to rock him Like my back aint got no bone

   I want a man to rock me Like my back-bone was his [A] own

   Darling, I know you [E] can

   Be[B7]lieve me when I tell you

   [A] You can love me like a [E] man [B7]

   I come home sad and lonely Feel like I want to die

   I want a man to hold me Not some fool to ask me why

   I need someone to love me Darling, I know you can

   Don't you put yourself above me Just love me like a man

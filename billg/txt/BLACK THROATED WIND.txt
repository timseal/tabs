   E F#m

   Bringing me down, I'm running aground,

   D A E

   Blind in the light of the interstate cars

   E F#m

   Passing me by, the busses and semi's,

   D A E

   Plunging like stones from a slingshot on mars

   A D C#m Bm A

   But I'm here by the road, bound to the load

   Bm E

   That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars

   A D C#m Bm A

   Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up

   Bm E

   The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

   D C#m A

   Black throated wind, keeps on pouring in

   E C A

   With its words of a life where nothing is new

   D C#m E A

   Ah, mother american night, I'm lost from the light

   G D A

   Oh, I'm drowning in you

   E F#m D A E

   I left St. Louis, city of blues, in the midst of a storm I'd rather forget

   E F#m

   I tried to pretend it came to an end

   D A E

   Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met

   A D C#m Bm A Bm

   But I can't deny, that times have gone by Bm

   Bm E

   Where I never had doubts or thoughts of regret

   A D C#m Bm A

   And I was a man when all this began

   Bm E

   Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet

   D C#m A

   Black throated wind, keeps on pouring in

   E C A

   And it speaks of a life that passes like dew

   D C#m E A

   It's forced me to see that you've done better by me

   G D A

   Better by me than I've done by you

   E F#m

   Now what's to be found racing around.

   D A E

   You carry your pain wherever you go

   E F#m

   All full of the blues and trying to lose

   D A E

   You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know

   A D C#m Bm A

   So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies

   Bm E

   Please help them to learn as well as to see

   A D C#m Bm A

   Capture a glance, and make it dance

   Bm E

   Of looking at you, looking at me

   D C#m A

   Black throated wind, keeps on pouring in

   E C A

   With its words of a lie that could almost be true

   D C#m E A

   Ah, mother american night, here comes the light

   G D A

   I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do

   G D A

   Going back home that's what I'm gonna do

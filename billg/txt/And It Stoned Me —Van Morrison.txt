   And It Stoned Me -Van Morrison

   G D

   Half a mile from the county fair

   C G

   And the rain came pourin' down

   G D

   Me and Billy standin' there

   C G

   With a silver half of crown

   G D

   Hands are full of fishin' rods

   C G

   And the tackle on our backs

   G D

   We just stood there gettin' wet

   C G

   With our backs against the fence

   Am D Am D

   Oh, the water, Oh, the water

   Am D Em

   Oh, the water, Hope it don't rain all

   D

   day

   G C G

   And it stoned my to my soul

   G D

   It stoned me just like jelly roll

   Em G

   And it stoned me

   G C G

   And it stoned me to my soul

   G D

   Stoned me just like goin' home

   Em G

   And it stoned me.

   G D

   And the rain let up and the sun came out

   C G

   And we were gettin' dry

   G D

   Almost let a pickup truck

   C G

   Nearly pass us by

   G D

   So we jumped right in and the driver grinned

   C G

   And he dropped us up the road

   G D

   And we looked at the swim and we jumped right

   C G

   Not to mention fishin' poles

   Am D Am D

   Oh, the water, Oh, the water

   Am D Em D

   Oh, the water, Let it run all over me

   G C G

   And it stoned my to my soul

   G D

   It stoned me just like jelly roll

   Em G

   And it stoned me

   G C G

   And it stoned me to my soul

   G D

   Stoned me just like goin' home

   Em G

   And it stoned me.

   On the way back home we sang a song

   But our throats were gettin' dry

   Then we saw the man from across the road

   With the sunshine in his eye

   Well, he looked all alone in his own little home

   With a great big gallon jar

   There were bottles two, one for me and you

   And he said, "Hey, there you are"

   Oh, the water, Oh, the water

   Oh, the water, Get it myself from the mountain stream

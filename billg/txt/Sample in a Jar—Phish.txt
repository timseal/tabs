   It's hidden far away, though someday I may tell

   A C G D

   The tale of mental tangle when into your world I fell

   A C G D

   Without you now I wander, soaking, secretly afraid

   A C G D

   But in your grasp the fears don't last, though some of them have stayed

   A D E D A

   I wheeled around because I didn't hear what you had said

   A D E D A

   And saw you dancing with Elihu, up on Leemor's bed

   A D E D A

   And I was foggy, rather groggy, you helped me to my car

   And on the market stands unfolding, with all the willies and thier wares

   A C G D

   I shuffle by alert but numb to all the glances and the glares

   A C G D

   I think of you unheeding all the times I raised my cup

   A C G D

   It's now I know that you knew that I'd soon end up end up

   You tricked me like the others, and now I don't belong

   A C D

   The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong

   [C]Hey where did we [F]go [C] days when the rai[G7]n came [C]

   Down in the hol[F]low, [C] playing a ne[G7]w game [C]

   Laughin' and a [F]runnin' hey, hey, [C]skipping and a [G7]jumping

   [C]In the misty morn[F]ing fog with[C] our hearts a thu[G7]mpin' [F]and
   you, [G7]

   My brown eyed [C]girl,[Am]  [F] you m[G7]y brown eyed g[C]irl [G7]

   [C]Whatever [F]happened [C]to Tuesdays [G7]and so slow [C]

   Going down the ol[C]d mine [F] with a transistor [G7]radio [C]

   Standing in the [C]sunlight laughing, [F] hiding behind [G7]a rainbow's
   wall, [C]

   Slipping and [F]sliding [C] all along the [G7]water fall with [F]you, [G7]

   My brown eyed [C]girl,[Am]  [F] you m[G7]y brown eyed g[C]irl

   [C]So hard to [F]find my way,[C] now that I'm all [G7]on my own [C]

   I saw you [F]just the other day, [C] my how [G7]you have grown [C]

   Cast my [F]memory back there, Lord [C]

   Sometimes I'm overcome [G7]think[C]ing 'bout

   Making love[F] in the green grass [C] behind the [G7]stadium with [F]you,
   [G7]

   Dear Abby, Dear Abby, my feet are too long

   My hair's falling out and my rights are all wrong

   My friends they all tell me, they're no friends at all

   Won't you write me a letter, won't you give me a

   G

   call

   Signed Bewildered

   Bewildered, Bewildered you have no complaint

   You are what you are and you ain't what you ain't

   So listen up buster listen up good

   Stop wishin' for bad luck and knockin' on wood

   Dear Abby, Dear Abby, my fountain pen leaks

   My wife hollers at me and my kids are all freaks

   Every side I get up on is the wrong side of bed

   If it weren't so expensive I'd wish I were dead

   Signed Unhappy

   Unhappy, Unhappy, you have no complaint ...

   You are what you are and you ain't what you ain't

   So listen up buster listen up good

   Stop wishin' for bad luck and knockin' on wood

   Dear Abby, Dear Abby, you won't believe this

   But my stomache makes noises whenever I kiss

   My girlfriend tells me it's all in my head

   But my stomache tells me to write you instead

   Signed Noisemaker.

   Noisemaker, Noisemaker, you have no complaint

   You are what you are and you ain't what you ain't

   So listen up buster listen up good

   Stop wishin' for bad luck and knockin' on wood

   Dear Abby, Dear Abby, well I never thought

   That me and my girlfriend would ever get caught

   We were sittin' in the back seat just shootin' the breeze

   With her hair up in curlers and her pants to her knees

   Signed Just Married

   Just Married, Just Married, you have no complaint ...

   You are what you are and you ain't what you ain't

   So listen up buster listen up good

   Stop wishin' for bad luck and knockin' on wood

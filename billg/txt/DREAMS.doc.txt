   DREAMS - Fleetwood intro: F G F G

   F G

   Now here you go again

   F G

   You say you want your freedom

   F G F

   Well who am I to keep you down?

   F G F G

   It's only right that you should play the way you feel it

   F G F

   But listen carefully to the sound

   F G F G

   Of your loneliness, like a heartbeat drives you mad

   F G F G

   In the stillness of remembering what you had

   G F G

   And what you lost

   G F G

   And what you had

   G F G

   And what you lost

   CHORUS:

   G Am G6 Am G6

   Oh thunder only happens when it's raining

   Am G6 Am G6

   Players only love you when they're playing

   Am G6 Am

   Say, women, they will come and they will go

   Am G6 Am

   When the rain washes you clean you'll know

   Am

   You'll know

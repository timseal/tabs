   St. James Infirmary

   Traditional blues

   Dm A7 Dm

   I went down to St. James Infirmary.

   Dm Gm A7

   I saw my Sweeheart there.

   Dm A7 Dm

   Lying on a table,

   Dm A7 Dm

   So cold, so white, so fair.

   Dm A7 Dm

   I went up to see the doctor.

   Dm Gm A7

   ``She's very low'' he said.

   Dm A7 Dm

   I went back to see my baby

   Dm A7 Dm

   And great God she was lying there dead

   I went down to old Joe's bar room.

   Down on the corner by the square.

   They were serving drinks as usual

   And the usual crowd was there.

   On my left stood Joe MacKennedy.

   His eyes were bloodshot red.

   He turned to the crowd around him

   And these were the words he said.

   Let her go. Let her go, God bless her.

   Where ever she may be.

   She may search this wide world over

   But she'll never find another man like me.

   When I die please bury me

   In a high top stetson hat.

   Put a gold piece on my watch chain,

   So the boys will know I died standing pat.

   Get six gambelers to carry my coffin.

   Six chorus girls to sing my song.

   Put a jazz band on my tail gate

   To raise hell as we roll along.

   This is the end of my story

   So let's have another round of booze.

   And if anyone should ask you just tell them

   I've got the St. James Infirmary blues.

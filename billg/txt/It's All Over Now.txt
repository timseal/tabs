   It's All Over Now (Womack)

   E7

   Well now, baby used to stay out all night long,

   E7

   Made me cry, Lord she done me wrong.

   E7

   Hurt my eyes open, and that's no lie,

   E7

   Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry,

   B7 A7 E7

   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.

   B7 A7 E7

   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.

   Well I used to wake the morning, get my breakfast in bed,

   When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head,

   But now she's here and there with every man in town'

   Still tryin' to take for that same old clown.

   B7 A7 E7

   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.

   B7 A7 E7

   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.

   Well she used to run around with every man in town,

   Spend all my money, Lord, play her high class games

   Put me out, it was a pity how I cried,

   Table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry,

   B7 A7 E7

   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.

   B7 A7 E7

   Because I used to love her, but it's all over now.

   B7 A7 E7

   Yes and I used to love her, but it's all over now.

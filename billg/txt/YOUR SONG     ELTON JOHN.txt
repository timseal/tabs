   YOUR SONG ELTON JOHN

   C Fmaj7 G Em

   It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside

   Am Am/G Am/F# F

   I'm not one of those, who can easily hide.

   C G E Am

   I don't have much money, but boy if I did

   C Dm7 F G

   I'd buy a big house where we both could live.

   C Fmaj7 G Em

   If I was a sculptor, huh, but then again no

   Am Am/G Am/F# F

   Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show

   C G E Am

   I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do

   C Dm7 F G

   My gift is my song, and this one's for you

   G Am Dm F

   And you can tell everybody, this is your song

   G Am Dm F

   It may be quite simple but now that it's done.

   Am Am/G

   I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,

   Am/F# F6

   That I put down in words,

   C Dm7 F G

   How wonderful life is while you're in the world.

   I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss

   Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross

   But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song

   It's for people like you, that keep it turned on

   So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do

   You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue

   Anyway the thing is, what I really mean

   Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

   And you can tell everybody, this is your song

   It may be quite simple but now that it's done

   I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

   That I put down in words

   How wonderful life is while you're in the world

   I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

   That I put down in words

   How wonderful life is while you're in the world.

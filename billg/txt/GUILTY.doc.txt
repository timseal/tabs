   GUILTY- Bonnie Raitt

   E E7

   Yes baby, I've been drinkin

   A Am

   Ya, I shouldn't come by I know

   E C#m

   But I found myself in trouble, darlin'

   B E A E B7

   And I had no place else to go

   E E7

   Got some whiskey from a barman

   A Am

   Got some cocaine from a friend

   E C#m

   And I had to keep on movin' babe

   B E A E E7

   Till' I was back in your arms again

   A Am

   But I'm guilty, yes I'm guilty

   E B E (bass F# G# B)

   And I'll be guilty all the rest of my life

   A Am

   How come I never do, what I'm supposed to do

   F# B (walk single notes) A - Ab-- F#

   Nothing I try to do ever turns out right

   E E7

   You know how it is with me baby,

   A Am

   You know I just can't stand myself

   E C#m

   It takes a whole lot of medicine

   B E A E

   For me to pretend that I'm somebody else

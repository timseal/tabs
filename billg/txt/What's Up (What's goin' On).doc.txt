   What's Up? * 4 Non Blondes *

   ******************************

   Chord progression goes like this throughout the entire song

   A Bmin D A

   [A] 25 years of my life and still

   [Bmin] Tryin' to to get up that great big hill of

   [D] Hope, for a destination. [A]

   [A] I realized quickly when I knew I should

   [Bmin] That the world was made up of this brotherhood of

   [D] Man, for whatever that means. [A]

   [Chorus]

   And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed

   just to get all out, what's in my head, then

   I, I am feeling, a little peculiar.

   And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside

   And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and

   I, scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?"

   And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."

   I said, "Hey, what's going on?"

   And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."

   I said, "Hey, what's going on?"

   [A] And I try, oh my god, do I try

   [Bmin] I try all the [D] time, in this institution. [A]

   [A] And I pray, oh my god, do I pray

   [Bmin] I pray every single [D] day, for a revolution. [A]

   [Chorus and last four lines of the chorus are repeated 2x more]

   [A] 25 years of my life and still

   [Bmin] Tryin' to to get up that great big hill of

   [D] Hope, for a destination. [A]

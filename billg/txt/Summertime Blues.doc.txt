   There ain't no cure for the summertime blues

   Well, my mom and poppa told me, "son, you gotta earn some money
   If you wanna use the car to go riding next sunday."
   Well I wouldn't go to work, I told the boss I was sick
   He said, "you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick."
   Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
   Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

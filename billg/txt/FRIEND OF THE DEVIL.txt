   Am D riff 1 (as D -> G)

   I just might get some sleep tonight

   Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills

   G G/F# G/E G/D C C/B C/A C/G

   I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

   Am D riff 1 (as D -> G)

   I just might get some sleep tonight

   G G/F# G/E G/D C C/B C/A C/G

   Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there

   G G/F# G/E G/D C C/B C/A C/G

   took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

   D

   Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night

   C/G

   The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie and she's my heart's delight

   D

   Second one is prison, baby, the shefiff's on my trail

   Am C D riff 3 (D -> G)

   and if he catches up with me I'll spend my life in jail

   Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee

   I just might get some sleep tonight

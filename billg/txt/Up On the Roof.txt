   Title: UP ON THE ROOF (Carol King)

   G Em

   When this old world starts getting me down

   C D G

   And people are just too much for me to face

   G Em

   I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs

   C D G

   And all my cares just drift right into space

   C

   On the roof it's peaceful as can be

   G Em C D

   And there the world below don't bother me

   G Em

   So when I come home feelin' tired and beat

   C D G

   I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet

   G Em

   I'll get away from the hustling crowd

   C D G

   And all that rat-race noise down in the street

   C

   On the roof that's the only place I know

   G Em C D

   Where you just have to wish to make it so

   (Lets go up on the roof)

   Lead

   C

   At night the stars put on a show for free

   G Em C D

   And darling you can share it all with me

   I keep on telling you that

   G Em

   Right smack dab in the middle of town

   C D G

   I've found a paradise that's trouble proof

   G Em

   And if this old world starts getting you down

   C D G Em

   There's room enough for two up on the roof

   C D

   Up on the roof

   G Em

   Up on the roof

   C D G

   Up on the roof

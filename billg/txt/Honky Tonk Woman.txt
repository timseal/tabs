   G C

   I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis

   G A D

   She tried to take me upstairs for a ride

   G C

   The lady had to heave me across her shoulder

   G D G

   Now I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

   CHORUS:

   G D G

   She's a honky tonk woman

   D G

   Give me, give me, give me the honky-tonk blues

   G D G

   Honky-tonk women

   D G

   Give me, give me, give me the honky-tonk blues

   I met a divorcee in New York City

   I had to put up some kind of a fight

   The lady went and covered me up in roses

   She blew my nose and then she blue my mind

   CHORUS TWICE

   A WHITER SHADE OF PALE-Keith Reid and Gary Brooker (Procul Harum)}

   Intro:

   C C/B C/A C/G F F/E Dm Dm/C

   G G/F Em G7 C F G F G7 C

   [Verse]

   C C/B Am Am/G F F/E Dm7

   We skipped the light fandango And turned cartwheels across the floor

   G G/F Em G7 C C/B Am Em

   I was feeling kind of seasick But the crowd called out for more

   F F/E Dm7 G G/F Em G7

   The room was humming harder As the ceiling flew away

   C C/B Am Em F F/E Dm7 G

   When we called out for another drink The waiter brought a tray

   [Chorus]

   G G C C C/B Am Am/G F F/E Dm7 G

   And so it was that later As the miller told his tale

   G G/F Em G7 C F C G7

   That her face at first just ghostly Turned a whiter shade of pale

   [Verse]

   C C/B Am Am/G F F/E Dm7 G

   She said "There is no reason, And the truth is plain to see,"

   G G/F Em G7 C C/B Am Em

   But I wandered through my playing cards And would not let her be

   F F/E Dm7 G G/F Em G7

   One of sixteen vestal virgins Who were leaving for the coast

   C C/B Am Em F F/E Dm7

   And although my eyes were open They might just as well have been closed

   [Chorus]

   G G C C C/B Am Am/G F F/E Dm7 G

   And so it was that later As the miller told his tale

   G G/F Em G7 C F C G7

   That her face at first just ghostly Turned a whiter shade of pale

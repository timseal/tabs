   Am(2) A7sus2 Asus4F#

   Almost cut my hair

   Am(2) A7sus2 Asus4F#

   It happened just the other day

   Am(2) A7sus2 Asus4F#

   It was getting kind of long

   Am(2) A7sus2 Asus4F#

   I could've said it was in my way

   C Em Am Am7

   But I didn't and I wonder why

   F Em

   I feel like letting my freak flag fly

   Dsus4 D Am A7sus2 Asus4F#

   Yes I feel like I owe it to someone

   Must be because I had the flu for Christmas

   And I'm not feeling up to par

   It increases my paranoia

   Like looking into a mirror and seeing a police car

   But I'm not giving in an inch to fear

   Cos I promised myself this year

   I feel like I owe it to someone

   When I finally get myself together

   I'm gonna get down in some of that sweet summer weather

   I'm going to find a space inside to laugh

   Separate the wheat from the chaff

   Cos I feel like I owe it, yeah

   Said I feel like I owe it, yeah

   You know I feel like I owe it yeah to someone

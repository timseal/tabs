   D, A7, D7

   ________________

   D A7

   Oh, its crying time again you're gonna leave me;

   D

   I can see that far away look in your eyes.

   D7 G

   I can tell by the way you hold me darling,

   D A7 D

   That it won't be long before it's crying time.

   D A7

   Oh, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder,

   D

   And that tears are only rain to make love grow

   D7 G

   Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger,

   D A7 D

   If I live to be a hundred years old.

   D A7

   Oh, you say that you found someone you loved better;

   D

   That's the way it's happened every time before.

   D7 G

   And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow,

   D A7 D

   Crying time will start when you walk out the door.

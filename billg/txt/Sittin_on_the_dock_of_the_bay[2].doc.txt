   Sittin on the dock of the bay-Otis
   Reddi Redding, Steve Cropper

   G G Bm7

   Sittin' in the mornin' sun

   C Am

   I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes

   G Bm7

   Watchin' the ships roll in

   C Am

   And I watch 'em roll away again

   G Em

   Sittin' on the dock of the bay

   G Em

   Watchin' the tide roll away

   G Am

   Sittin' on the dock of the bay

   G Em

   Wastin' time

   G Bm7

   I left my home in Georgia

   C Am

   Headed for the Frisco Bay

   G Bm7

   I have nothin' to live for

   C Am

   Look like nothin's gonna come my way

   G Em

   Ch: Sittin' on the dock of the bay

   G Em

   Watchin' the tide roll away

   G Am

   Sittin' on the dock of the bay

   G Em

   Wastin' time

   B:

   G G D C

   Looks like nothin's gonna change

   G D C

   Everything still remains the same

   G D C

   I can't do what ten people tell me to do

   F D

   So I guess I'll remain the same

   G Bm7

   Sittin' here restin' my bones

   C Am

   Wish this loneliness would leave me alone

   G Bm7

   For 2,000 miles I roam

   C Am

   Just to make this dock my home

   G Em

   Ch: Sittin' on the dock of the bay

   G Em

   Watchin' the tide roll away

   G Am

   Sittin' on the dock of the bay

   G Em

   Wastin' time

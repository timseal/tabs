   Well hello there

   Bb F Bb_F Bb_F

   My it's been a long, long time

   F Bb-F-F-Bb

   How am I doing?

   Bb F Bb-F Bb-F

   I guess I'm doing fine

   F F7

   Been so long now, but it seems like

   Bb Dm G

   It was only yesterday

   C Bb Dm Gm F C7

   Ain't it funny, how time slips a-way

   How's your new love

   I hope he's doing fine

   Heard you told him, you're gonna love him

   'til the end of time

   Well that's the same thing, that you told me

   Seems like only the other day

   Ain't it funny, how time slips away

   Gotta go now

   I guess I'll see you around

   Don't know when though

   I'll be back in this town

   But just remember, what I told you

   In time you're going to pay

   And it's funny, funny funny how time slips away

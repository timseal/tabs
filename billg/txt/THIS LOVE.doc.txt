   This love cannot be bought or sold

   And the shadows flee away

   I'll break the chains of fear in the name of this love

   Laugh away the tears in the name of this love

   Oh, daughters of Jerusalem, I have seen the day break

   Em A G5* G5*

   And the shadows flee away

   G5* G5* G5* G5* G5* G5* G5* G5*

   Oo oo oo oooo oo ooo ooo, Oo oo oo oooo oo ooo ooo

   I'll break the chains of fear in the name of this love

   Laugh away the tears in the name of this love

   G F C F - C G F C F - C

   Name of this love

   G F C F - C G F C F - C G.

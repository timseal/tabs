   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   Right outside this lazy summer home

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no

   A C#m B A

   Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home

   C#m B D A

   Wonderin' where the nut-thatch winter's wings a mile long

   E A E A C

   Just carried the bird away

   (chorus)

   G C G C

   Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world

   G C G C

   But the heart has its beaches, its homelands and thoughts of its own

   D C G C

   Wake now, discover, that you are the song that morning brings

   G C D Bm A

   But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

   There comes a redeemer and he slowly too fades away

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   There follows a wagon behind him that's loaded with clay

   A C#m B A

   And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay- ay

   E A E A C

   And night comes so quiet it's close on the heels of the day

   (chorus)

   Sometimes we live no particular way but our own

   Emaj7 A Emaj7 Bm A

   Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home

   A C#m B A

   Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone

   E A E A C

   Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

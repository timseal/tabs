   TITLE: Accidentally Like a Martyr

   Lyrics and Chords

   [Capo 3]

   D A Bm D

   The phone don't ring, no no

   Em7 D G

   And the sun refused to shine

   A Bm A G D

   Never thought I'd have to pay so dearly

   Em D G Bm7

   For what was already mine

   E7 A

   For such a long, long time

   {Refrain}

   D A

   We made mad love, shadow love

   G D

   Random love and abandoned love

   D A

   Accidentally like a martyr

   C G G D

   The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder

   D A

   We made mad love, shadow love

   G D

   Random love and abandoned love

   D A

   Accidentally like a martyr

   C G G D

   The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder

   D A Bm D

   The days slide by

   Em7 D G

   Should have done, should have done, we all sigh

   A Bm A G D

   Never thought I'd ever be so lonely

   Em D G Bm7

   After such a long, long time

   E7 A

   Time out of mind

   {Refrain}

   D A

   We made mad love, shadow love

   G D

   Random love and abandoned love

   D A

   Accidentally like a martyr

   C G G D

   The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder

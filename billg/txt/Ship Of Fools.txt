   Ship Of Fools (Garcia/Hunter)

   C G F

   Went to see the captain

   F#o7 C

   Strangest I could find

   E F

   Laid my proposition down,

   Dm G

   Laid it on the line.

   F C

   I won't slave for beggar's pay,

   Em Dm

   Likewise gold and jewels,

   F C

   But I would slave to learn the way

   G F C

   To sink your ship of fools.

   G F C

   Ship of fools on a cruel sea,

   G F Am

   Ship of fools sail away from me.

   F#o7

   It was later than I thought when I first believed you,

   Dm G F C

   Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

   C G F

   Saw your first ship sink and drown,

   F#o7 C

   From rockin' of the boat,

   E F

   And all that could not sink or swim

   Dm G

   Was just left there to float.

   F C

   I won't leave you drifting down,

   Em Dm

   But whoa it makes me wild,

   F C

   With thirty years upon my head

   G F C

   To have you call me child.

   G F C

   Ship of fools on a cruel sea,

   G F Am

   Ship of fools sail away from me.

   F#o7

   It was later than I thought when I first believed you,

   Dm G F C

   Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

   C G F

   The bottles stand as empty,

   F#o7 C

   As they were filled before.

   E F

   Time there was and plenty,

   Dm G

   But from that cup no more.

   F C

   Though I could not caution all,

   Em Dm

   I still might warn a few:

   F C

   Don't lend your hand to raise no flag

   G F C

   Atop no ship of fools.

   G F C

   Ship of fools on a cruel sea,

   G F Am

   Ship of fools sail away from me.

   F#o7

   It was later than I thought when I first believed you,

   Dm G F C

   Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

   Am F#o7

   It was later than I thought when I first believed you,

   Dm G F C

   Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools.

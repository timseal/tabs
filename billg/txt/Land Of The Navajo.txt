   Land Of The Navajo

   Old & In The Way

   (Rowan)

   [Intro: Em (4 bars)]

   [Chorus]

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, on the trail of the buffalo

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, in the land of the Navajo

   C D Em

   In the land of the Navajo

   G C

   A hundred miles from nowhere out on the desert sand

   D G

   One-eyed Jack, the trader, held some torquoise in his hand

   G C

   By his side stood Running Elk, his long-time indian friend

   D G

   He vowed that he would stay by Jack until the bitter end

   Jack had gambled everything he owned to lead this wanderin life

   He might've had a happy home and a tender loving wife

   But his hunger was for trading trapper's furs for torquoise stone

   Anything that the indians had, Jack wanted for his own

   [Chorus]

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, on the trail of the buffalo

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, in the land of the Navajo

   C D Em

   In the land of the Navajo

   Said Jack to Running Elk, I'll gamble all my precious stones

   Before I leave my body here among these bleachin bones

   But now my time is drawing near and I'm filled with dark regrets

   My spirit longs to journey as the sun begins to set

   For we raped and killed, we stole your land

   We ruled with guns and knives

   Fed whiskey to your warriors while we stole away your wives

   Said Running Elk, what's done is done, you white men rule this land

   So lay the cards face up and play your last broken-hearted hand

   [Chorus]

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, on the trail of the buffalo

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, in the land of the Navajo

   C D Em

   In the land of the Navajo

   When you're dealing cards with death, the joker's wild, the ace's high

   Jack bid the Mississippi River, Running Elk raised him the sky

   Jack saw him with the sun and moon and upped him with the stars

   Running Elk bet the Rocky Mountains, Jupiter, and Mars

   The sun was sinking in the west when Jack drew the ace of spades

   Running Elk just rolled his eyes, his smiling passed away

   Jack picked up his torquoise stones and cast them to the sky

   He stared into the setting sun and then made the mournful cry

   [Chorus]

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, on the trail of the buffalo

   C G D Em

   Oh, the wind blows cold, in the land of the Navajo

   C D Em

   In the land of the Navajo

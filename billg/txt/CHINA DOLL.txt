   in 4/4 except the line "china doll" which is in 2/4

   Dm Fmaj7 Bo7 Bb

   A pistol shot at five o'clock; the bells of heaven ring.

   A7 Dm F C

   Tell me what you done it for. No I won't tell you a thing.

   Dm Fmaj7 Bo7 Bb

   Yesterday I begged you before I hit the ground.

   A7 Dm F C A7

   All I leave behind me is only what I've found.

   Dm Fmaj7 Bo7 Bb

   If you can abide it let the hurdy-gurdy play.

   A7 Dm F C

   Stranger ones have come by here before they flew away.

   Dm Fmaj7 Bo7 Bb

   I will not condemn you nor yet would I deny.

   A7 Dm F C Am A7 D

   I would ask the same of you but failing, will not die.

   D A G

   Take up you china doll. It's only fractured;

   Desc treble g f# e d b g D G D G Desc treble g f# e d b g D

   Just a little nervous from the fall. La la la la la la la.

   Dm: xx0231 Fmaj7: xx3210 Bo7: x2x131

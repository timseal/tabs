   BLUE BAYOU (Roy Orbison)

   ------------------------

   C C G G

   I feel so bad, I got a worried mind; I'm so lonesome all the time

   G G C C

   Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

   C C G G

   Saving nickels, saving dimes; working till the sun don't shine

   G G C C

   Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

   C C G G

   I'm going back someday, come what may to Blue Bayou

   C C G G

   Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou

   C C7 F Fm6

   Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see

   C G C C

   That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be

   Gonna see my baby again

   Gonna be with some of my friends

   Maybe I'll feel better again on Blue Bayou

   Saving nickels, saving dimes

   Working till the sun don't shine

   Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou

   I'm going back someday, come what may to Blue Bayou

   Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou

   Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see

   That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be

   Oh that boy of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evening time

   C G C C

   Oh, some sweet day, gonna take away this hurtin' inside

   G G G G

   Well I'd never be blue, my dreams come true

   G G C C C C.

   On Blue Bayou

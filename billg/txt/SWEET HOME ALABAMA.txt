   D C G

   Big wheels keep on turning

   D C G

   Carry me home to see my kin.

   D C G

   Singing songs about the southland

   D C G

   I miss'ole' 'bamy once again (and I think it's a sin)

   Well, I heard Mister Young sing about her

   Well, I heard ole Neil put her down.

   Well, I hope Neil Young will remember,

   A southern man don't need him around anyhow

   Sweet home Alabama,

   Where the skies are so blue, CHORUS (and the chords

   Sweet home Alabama, _still_ don't change!)

   Lord, I'm coming home to you.

   F C D

   In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor Boo hoo hoo !

   Now we all did what we could do.

   Now Watergate does not bother me.

   Does your conscience bother you? (tell the truth)

   CHORUS

   Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers

   And they've been known to pick a tune or two

   Lord they get me off so much

   They pick me up when I'm feeling blue

   Now how about you?

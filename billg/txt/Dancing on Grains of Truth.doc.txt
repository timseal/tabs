   DANCIN ON GRAINS O TRUTH. (2X for intro)

   (Em) B7

   1. He tells her that he's workin at the office late tonight

   A G Em

   but everybody knows he's handing her a line.

   2. She tells him that she's workin late at the store takin inventory

   but there's a boy on the stockroom floor who tells a different story. (to
   CHORUS)

   3. He tells her pretty lies, as he's holding her so close.

   But everybody knows he's thinking 'bout the girl he loves the most.

   4. She tells him that she loves him, he's doing everything all right.

   But somewhere in her fantasy she knows another boy seems right. (to
   CHORUS)

   5. He came home the other day, only had half his pay

   Said he threw it 'cross the bar that he hangs in, down the way.

   6. She walked out into the night, back to the place with the party lights.

   With the wedding band missing from her married hand, she said, "I'm
   no-one's wife tonight." (to CHORUS)

   7. Sittin' back and lookin' at the world and all its dreams,

   Has anything ever turned out the way it really seems?

   8. The only thing I'll tell you, if you're glory-ing in your youth, is,

   "Watch where you put your feet down, children, 'cause you're DANCIN' ON
   GRAINS O' TRUTH!" (to CHORUS times 2)*

   * On 2nd chorus, 3rd line ("Sometimes seems..."), slow down exponentially
   into big finish

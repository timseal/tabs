   Midnight Rider - Allman Brothers

   D G

   I got to run to keep from hiding

   D G

   And I'm bound to keep on riding

   D G

   And I've got one more silver dollar

   C G

   But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no

   C D

   Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider

   I don't own the clothes I wear

   And the road goes on forever

   And I've got one more silver dollar

   But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no

   Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider

   I've gone past the point of caring

   About whose bed I'll soon be sharing

   And I've got one more silver dollar

   But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no

   Not gonna let them catch the midnight rider

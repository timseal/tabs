   B E

   You need an  hour, you can borrow  mine

   B F# B

   B F# B

   Buyin' time they say is a dangerous thing

   B F#7

   (spoken)

   B F# B

   You know I'm hungry when I wake up,

   B F#7

   I'll be damned if I'm not sleepy when I eat

   E F# B

   The only time I feel good, is when I got a

   E

   little dirt underneath my feet

   B F# B

   I don't mind eating fast food, as

   B F#7

   long as I can eat it real slow

   E F#

   I'm gonna have me some high times, but I

   B E

   might lay them way down low

   Leavin' town you told me on an Amtrak

   B

   passenger train ...

   B

   I should have know, from the sound of your

   F#7

   sad refrain ...

   E F#

   You need some cash, you got to go

   B E

   How about a  slow game of dominoes, (you know what I'm talkin' about)

   I've got  all the  time in the  world

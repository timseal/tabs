   Too Soon To Tell - Subdudes

   D7

   You asked me last night if I knew what I wanted

   and I replied that I feel like my soul is haunted

   G

   I've been dreamin' about  this perfect thing between us

   D

   and in your eyes I see  a trusted soul you possess

   A G D

   but it's too soon... too soon... to tell

   D7

   I've been doin' some soul searchin' in the middle of the night

   and every now and then I feellike maybe I've got it right

   G

   your little girl ways and womanly glances

   D

   tell me I've found a thing that speaks of true romances

   A G D

   but it's too soon...too soon to tell

   Instrumental Bridge:

   G / / / D / / /

   G / / / E / / /

   A / B / C / C#/ / D

   D7

   So if you hear me sayin'somethin' crazy in my sleep

   Don't hold each word so dear, nocturnal talk is cheap

   G

   wake me up and ask me what's on my mind

   D

   I'll tell you right then and there you are the lovin kind

   A G D

   but it's too soon ... too soon to tell

   A G D

   but it's too soon ... too soon to tell

   A G D

   but it's too soon ... too soon to tell

   Note: that C# at the end of the bridge is pretty much an implied chord.

   There are some single note accordian lines there but nothing else so you

   can throw in a C#dim or C#m7 or just a riff...SEASON TO TASTE! Whatever

   you do you have nowhere else to go but D ;-)

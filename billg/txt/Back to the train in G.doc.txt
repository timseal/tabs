   When I jumped off, I had a bucket full of thoughts

   G C Bb

   When I first jumped off, I held that bucket in my hand

   G

   Ideas that would take me all around the world

   C Bb

   I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountain curl

   F C G

   It took me a long time to get back on the train

   Now I'm gone and I'll never look back again

   I'm gone and I'll never look back at all

   You know I'll never look back again

   I turn my face into the howlin' wind

   It took me a long time to get back on the train

   See my face in the town that's flashing by

   See me standing at the station in the rain

   See me standing there beside the car

   I left it all behind, again I'll travel far

   It took me a long time to get back on the train

   When I jumped off, I had a bucket full of thoughts

   When I first jumped off, I held that bucket in my hand

   Ideas that would take me all around the world

   I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountains curl

   It took me a long time to get back on the train

   It took me a long time to get back on the train

   It took me a long time to get back on the train

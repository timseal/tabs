Subject: The new pavement tuning guide
<P>
I'm so pissed off at how nothing is happening at the pavement websites
that I decided to post these guitar tunings.  I've been looking at the old
pavement guide and I agreed with some of it but found a lot of false
things.  I'd really like these tunings to be put up if you don't mind
because I know they are pretty accurate and make a lot of sense.  I have
been playing for a very long time so I know what I'm doing.  One day when
I have nothing to do I might post the catalog of tabs I have with the
correct way to play them.  But I'm not going to waste my time if no one
will post them. I've been studying malkmus during his performances
and seeing how he has been playing these songs.  The only tunings I use
are the ones that come out of his mouth.

<P>
Westing and Slanted's tunings are all DADABE and CBDGBE
<P>
The tunings DADFBF, FGCFCF do not exist.<BR>
I'm not sure about that DADGAC# tuning.<BR>
The tuning DADF#AD for type slowly is probably not correct because I don't
think malkmus uses the common open D tuning.  It's probably DADABE but I
have not fucked around with that song enough. [corrected to FA#DFA#F, see
above -rob]
<P>
Shady and fin are in standard
<P>
I'm still debating on the tuning for range life and Blue Hawaiian.  I'm
doing this off the top of my head so I know I forgot a lot of songs.  I
will be getting the shady import soon so that will have a couple more
songs to figure out.
<P>
Please reply or post the tunings.<BR>

thanks to <a href="mailto:"laywork@cp.duluth.mn.us">ken larson</A> for
creating The Pavement Tuning Guide 1.0.  I've consolidated agreements
between 1.0 and 1.5 into 1.5.  if anyone can be sure about stuff listed
below, let me know and i'll move it up to 1.5. (especially if its CDGDBB
or CGDGBB)...if that makes sense.

**Disclaimer** This guide is by no means certian! Some of this i'm pretty
sure about but I could be wrong.  I'll update from time to time.

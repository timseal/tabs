Intro:

A F#m E D A

A
After the glow, the scene, the stage, the set

F#m                                                   E
Talk becomes slow but there's one thing I'll never forget,

(E)                            D                A
Hey, you gotta pay your dues before you pay the rent

A
Over the turnstiles and out in the traffic,

        F#m                                               E
there's ways of livin', it's the way I'm livin', right or wrong,

(E)                           D                      A
it's all that I can do, and I wouldn't wanna let you be.

CHORUS:
        Amaj7
I wanna range life,

           F#m
If I could settle down,

           Bm
If I could settle down,

             F#m
Then I would settle down.  (play twice, second time go on to:


E  E  E

Run from the pigs, the fuzz, the cops, the heat,
Pass me your gloves, there's crime and it's never complete,
until you snort it up or shoot it down,
you're never gonna feel free

Out on my skateboard, the night is just hummin',
the gumsmacks are the pulse I'll follow, and if my walkman
fades,
I got absolutely no one, no one but my self to blame.

E            D          A
Don't worry, were in no hurry

E7            D              A
School's out, what did you expect

CHORUS


Out on tour with the smashing pumpkins,
nature kids, I, they don't have no function,
I don't understand what they mean,
and I could really give a fuck.

Stone temple pilots, the elegant bachelors,
they're foxy to me are they foxy to you,
I will agree, it doesn't, absolutely nothin',
nothin' more than me.

Dreamin' and dream dream dream dream, etc...

End on A, for a while.

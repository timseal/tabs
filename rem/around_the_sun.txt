          Em              D#              C             A#   Am
    It's quiet now, and what it brings is everything...
          Em              D#                   C             A#   Am           /|
   Comes calling back a brilliant night, I'm still awake                      / |
      Em               D#              C              A#   Am                   |
   I looked ahead I'm sure I saw you there                                    __|
        Em               D#                 C              A#   Am
   You don't need me to tell you now, that nothing can compare



G                               D
   You might have laughed if I told you
    C                          Am
   You might have hidden the frown                                             
        G                        D                                             __
   You might have succeeded in changing me                                    |  |
   C                          Am                                                /
   I might have been turned around                                             / 
         G                       D                                            |__|
   It's easier to leave than to be left behind                                
    C                     Am
   Leaving was never my proud
    G                      D
   Leaving New York never easy
   C                      Am
   I saw the life fading out



Now life is sweet and what it brings I tried to take...                         /|
The loneliness, it wears me out, it lies in way                                / |
And on our lost till in my eyes, shadow of necklace across your thigh            |
I might have lived my life in a dream, but i swear, this is real               __|

Memory fuses in shatters out glass, but carry your future, forget the past
But it's you, it's what i feel. 



You might have laughed if I told you (it's pulling me apart)                    __
You might have hidden the frown (change)                                       |  |
You might have succeeded in changing me (it's pulling me apart)                  /
I might have been turned around (change)                                        /
It's easier to leave than to be left behind (it's pulling me apart)            |__|
Leaving was never my proud (change)
Leaving New York never easy (it's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out

                                                                               | I |

   You find it in your heart, it's pulling me apart                            | T |
Em                      D#                                                     | R |
   You find it in your heart, change...                                        | O |



I told you, forever, I love you, forever

          C                F
   You're on your ear, the ocean's near 
        C                    F
   The light has started to fade 
         C                  F

     F                                                                            |

      C                    F

       F
   It singes blue 
         C                 F
   Your buzz beginning to wane.

But in your eyes                                                                / |

And didn't know where to run                                                    __|
I looked to her

You know where to run 
You run electron blue 



F



So bide your time 
You'll feel the climb 
Your high it builds like a lightning storm                                       /|
It sings like pearls                                                            / |
You know that girl                                                                |
And no one is any the wiser                                                     __|
So as if on cue.....

Intro: Em D Em

   You took me to the restaurant where we first met                            / |
Em                              D        Em                                      |
   You knocked a future shock crowbar upside my head                           __|



Em                         D          G          Am         Em
   I got caught with the stop of the tick-tock, tick-tock clock
                      D        Em                                               __

    Em          D                                                                /
   Lost in the moment                                                           /

   The day that the music stopped

   And I do remember you 



C                                       D

C                                  D                                              |
   Where will this lead us - I'm scared of the storm                           |__|
        Em            D            Em
   The outsiders are gathering, a new day is born 


 
I tried to tell you I am not afraid                                              /|
You looked up and saw it all across my face                                     / |
So am I with you or am I against                                                  |
I don't think it's that easy - we're lost in regret                             __|

The day that the music stopped                                                  /

Chords for this part: Em D G Am



A man walks away when every muscle says to stay 
How many yesterdays - they each weigh heavy 
Who says what changes may come? 
Who says what we call home? 
I know you see right through me, my luminescence fades 
The dusk provides an antidote, I am not afraid 
I've been a million times in my mind 
This is really just a technicality, frailty, reality 

Uh, it's time to breathe, time to believe 
Let it go and run towards the sea 
They don't teach that, they don't know what you mean 
They don't understand, they don't know what you mean 
They don't get it, I wanna scream 
I wanna breathe again, I wanna dream 
I wanna float a quote from Martin Luther King 
I am not afraid 
I am not afraid 
I am not afraid 

I am not afraid 
I am not afraid 
I am not afraid 
I am not afraid

Make It All Ok



Intro: F


          F            Am              Dm                C
   You threw away the ballast and you rowed your boat ashore
           Gm               C                                                    /|
   Didn't you, now? Didn't you?                                                 / |
        F             Am        Dm       C                                        |
   You made your ultimatum too big to ignore                                    __|
           Gm               C
   Didn't you, now? Didn't you?


           Am
   So you worked out your excuses, 
            D
   turned away and shut the door.
        Am                                                                      __
   The world's too vast for us now,                                            |  |
            D                                                                    / 
   and you wanted to explore                                                    /
           Em              C                                                   |__|
   It's a long, long long road
          Em                      C
   And I don't know which way to go
          Em                              Dm            C            A#
   If you offered me your hand again I'd have to walk away.




When I saw you at the street fair, you called out my name                        /|

Didn't you, now? Didn't you?                                                    / |
You said we could start over, try and make it all okay.                           |
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?                                                    __|



So our past has been rewritten 
and you threw away the pen.                                                     __
You'd said that I was useless,                                                 |  |
but now you'll take me in again                                                  /
Well Jesus loves me fine.                                                       /
And your words fall flat this time.                                            |__|
Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,
"We don't have a prayer between us."



Didn't you believe that I have finally turned away?                              /|
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?                                                    / |
Anything to hold onto to help me through my day.                                  |
Didn't you, now? Didn't you?                                                    __|


    Am             D
   Jesus loves me fine.
            Am                   D
   But his words fall flat this time.
           Em              C
   It's a long, long long road
          Em                      C
   And I don't know which way to go
          Em                               C
   If you offered me your world, did you think I'd really stay?
          Em                               C
   If you offered me the heavens, I would have to turn away.
           Em                 Dm             C
   Was it my imagination, or did I hear you say,
              A# 
   "We don't have a prayer between us." 
           A#               A#
   Didn't you, now? Didn't you, now?
            F
   Didn't you?

         Dm                    C         Dm
   As I raise my head to broadcast my objection 
            Dm                    C          Dm                                  /|
   As your latest triumph draws the final straw                                 / |
        Dm                     C     Dm                                           |
   Who died and lifted you up to perfection?                                    __|
             Dm              C           Dm
   And what silenced me is written into law. 


      C                                      Dm

   I can't believe where circumstance has thrown me                             __
          C             Dm                                                     |  |
   And I turn my head away                                                       /
         C                              Dm                                      /
   If I look I'm not sure that I could face you.                               |__|
         Am          C          Dm
   Not again. Not today. Not today. 



If hatred makes a play on me tomorrow                                            /|
And forgiveness takes a back seat to revenge                                    / |
There's a hurt down deep that has not been corrected                              |
There's a voice in me that says you will not win.                               __|


                                                                                __
And if I ignore the voice inside,                                              |  |
Raise a half glass to my home.                                                   /
But it's there that I am most afraid,                                           /
And forgetting doesn't hold. It doesn't hold.                                  |__|



          F                
   Now I don't believe and I never did 
         Dm
   That two wrongs make a right. 
           F
   If the world were filled with the likes of you 
             Dm                               F
   Then I'm putting up a fight. Putting up a fight. 
                 Dm             Am             C              Dm
   Putting up a fight. Make it right. Make it right. 



Now love cannot be called into question.                                         /|
Forgiveness is the only hope I hold.                                            / |
And love... love will be my strongest weapon.                                     |
I do believe that I am not alone.                                               __|


                                                                                __
For this fear will not destroy me.                                             |  |
And the tears that have been shed                                                /
It's knowing now where I am weakest                                             /
And the voice in my head. In my head.                                          |__|


                                                                                __
Then I raise my voice up higher                                                |  |
And I look you in the eye                                                        /
And I offer love with one condition.                                            /
With conviction, tell me why.                                                  |__|
Tell me why. 
             Am
   Tell me why.

   Look me in the eye.

   Tell me why.

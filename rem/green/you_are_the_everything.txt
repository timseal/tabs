YOU ARE THE EVERYTHING

{intro   Am}

G                                  D
Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing
                          G
I'm very scared for this world
                    D
I'm very scared for me
                   G
Eviscerate your memory
         G
Here's a scene
       D
You're in the back seat laying down
    G
The windows wrap around you
    D
The sound of the travel and the engine
C               G                  C
All you hear is time stand still in travel
                          G
You feel such peace and absolue
                           C
The stillness still that doesn't end
                   G
But slowly drifts into sleep
      D
The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen
     D
And they're there for you
     D                            G
For you alone you are the everything

     G                 D
I think about this world a lot and I cry
      G                         D
And I've seen the films and the eyes
                  G
But I'm in this kitchen
          D
Everything is beautiful
          G
And she is so beautiful
                 D
She is so young and old
                  C
I look at her and I see the beauty
     G
Of the light of music
      C                       G
The voice is talking somewhere in the house
                 C
Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep
         D
With your teeth in your mouth
D
You are here with me
D
You are here with me
D                     Am
You have been here and you are everything

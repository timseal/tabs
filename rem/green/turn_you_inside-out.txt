Verse:
B                    A          D
Divide your cultured pearls and paste 
I'm looking for to lay to waste
Of all the things I cannot taste
This is not the wasted race
They spoke loud

E
I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you
It's what you do

B                A      D
I could turn you inside out
I could turn you inside-out
But I choose not to do
 
Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers

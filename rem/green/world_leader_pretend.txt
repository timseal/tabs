WORLD LEADER PRETEND

 {between the Em and Bm chords play this ----
  (D) -0-2-4-2-0-                  }

{intro  Em   Bm   Em   Bm  Em   Bm    G     A }

  D            G    C                 D
 I sit at my table and wage war on myself
  D   G               C                  D
 It seems like it's all...it's all for nothing
  D           G         C
 I know the barricades, and
               D             D
 I know the mortar in the wall breaks
      G                  C                 D
 I recognize the weapons, I used them well

  Em  Bm
  Em                  Bm
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good
  Em                     Bm                            G    A
 I raised the wall, and I will be the one to knock it down

 I've a rich understanding of my finest defenses
 I proclaim that claims are left unstated,
 I demand a rematch
 I decree a stalemate
 I divine my deeper motives
 I recognize the weapons
 I've practiced them well. I fitted them myself

 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...empathize
 This is my mistake.  Let me make it good
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down

{I lose track of where the chords occur over the words. They just
 switch between Am and C  until the last part of this section...}

  Am            C          Am                     C
 Reach out for me and hold me tight.  Hold that memory
     Am           C           Am             A           G
 Let my machine talk to me.  Let my machine talk to me

 This is my world
 And I am the world leader pretend
 This is my life
 And this is my time
 I have been given the freedom
 To do as I see fit
 It's high time I've razed the walls
 That I've constructed

 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...emapathize
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down

 You fill in the mortar. You fill in the harmony
 You fill in the mortar. I raised the walls
 And I'm the only one
 I will be the one to knock it down

{end on Em}

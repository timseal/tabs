Em
I've watched the children come and go
A2                  Em
A late long march into spring
  A2                      Em
I sit and watch those children
                 A2
Jump in the tall grass
Em
Leap the sprinkler
A2
Walk in the ground
    Em             A2
Bicycle clothespin spokes
              Em                A2
The sound the smell of swingset hands

       D                        (Riff)
I will try to sing a happy song
             D                    (Riff)
I'll try and make a happy game to play

Come play with me I whispered to my new found friend
Tell me what it's like to go outside
I've never been
Tell me what it's like to just go outside
I've never been
And I never will

I'm not supposed to be like this
I'm not supposed to be like this
But it's okay

Hey those kids are looking at me
I told my friend myself
Those kids are looking at me
They're laughing and they're running over here
They're laughing and they're running over here
What do I do?
What can I do?
What should I do?
What do I say?
What can I say?

I said I'm no supposed to be like this
Let's try to find a happy game to play
Let's try to find a happy game to play
I'm not supposed to be like this
But it's okay...okay

GET UP

{intro: E B C G A       E B C G Bb}


A                  D
Sleep delays my life
                      A
Where does the time go...go
          D
I don't know
                      A
Sleep sleep sleepy head
         D
Wake it up...up
                      A
You've got all your life
          D
Way up ahead

 E      B     C    G        A
Dreams they complicate my life
 E      B     C    G        Bb
Dreams they compliment my life

I've seen you laying pined
I've seen you laying pined
Life is rough...rough
I've seen you laying down...down
With the loving kind
I know life is hard...hard
Well now
Where to turn?

This time there's no escape
To dreamtime

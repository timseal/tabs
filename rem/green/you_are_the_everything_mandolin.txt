FIRST VERSE
G				     D	
Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing
		     G
I'm very scared for this world, I'm very
	    D			    G
scared for me.  Eviscerate your memory.
		 	D
Here's a scene, you're in the backseat
	 	   G
laying down, the windows, wrap around
	 D			   C
to the sound of the travel and the engine.
		G			 C
All you hear is time stand still in travel.
			G
You feel such peace and absolute, the stillness
           C			          G
still that doesn't end but slowly drifts into sleep

the stars are the...*

*right after "stars are the"  ---1-0---------
		       	      --------5-0----
			      -------------0-
  			      ---------------

the chorus goes...

--5-5-5-5-3-5-0-0-3-2-0-------
------------------------3-0---
------------------------------
------------------------------

repeat chorus until "everything" where you start the G/D to G/C progression
all over again...

CHORUS...
greatest thing you've ever seen

they're there for you
				  G 
for you alone, you are the everything 

SECOND VERSE
		    D
I think about this world a lot
	   G
I cry and I've seen the films and
      D			  G
the eyes.  I mend this kitchen.  
		D
Everything is beautiful.  She is so
	G			 D
beautiful, she is so young and old
		  C
i look at her and I see the beauty of 
     G		     C
the light of music.  The voices talking
 		 G
somewhere in the house late spring and your
C
drifting off to sleep with your
G
teeth in your mouth. 

*End the verse the same way as before 

CHORUS
You are here with me

You are here with me

You have been here and you are the everything

*Chorus is played the same BUT...instead of going to a G chord and another
verse, play the Am intro with the pull-off and THEN go to the G/D G/C verse
progression

VERSE THREE

Same as the first verse.  The third verse chorus is...

You are here with me

You are here with me

You have been here and you are everything

You have been here and you are everything

end with...

--5-5-5-5-3-5-3-5-0--0--
---------------------0--
---------------------2--
---------------------2--

This is a pretty basic and dry version...
With a little practice and some subtle changes you can make this one
sound real nice. Any other mandolin playing R.E.M. fans out there?
This is the first time I've ever done this so.....

until the day is done-

until the day is done is great song to play. it's pretty complex with
a heap of overdubs and even a mandolin, but here is a "buskers"
version.

intro: Dsus2 hammer on/off A (2nd fret) on 3rd string

verse: Dsus2 C Am7 Dsus2 slide up 2 frets (not sure what you'd
actually call this chord but given that the notes are EEBD is acts as
a type of E7, but you need the slide to get the same effect as the
album) slide back to Dsus2 C Am7

pre chorus fill: the actual notes are A G F# E on the first string but
if playing by yourself it works better to play them an octave
lower. in other words A (2nd fret, 3rd string) G (open 3rd string) F#
(4th fret, 4th string) E (2nd fret, 4th string) which gives a neat
transition from Dsus2 to the first chord of the chorus

chorus: C G Dsus2

Mr. Richards

I think starts with an E at the seventh fret with the top E and B string open.
For the "your decision/pay attention" part it goes to A at the fifth fret, again with the two open strings.

Em at the seventh, down to D.

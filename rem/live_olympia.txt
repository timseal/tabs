Verse:

B
It's only when your poison spins into the life you'd hoped to live
                                                A
and suddenly you wake up in a shaken panic now
B
You had set me up like a lamb to slaughter

Garbo as a farmer's daughter

Unbelievable, the gospel according to who?
             A
I lay right down

Chorus:

F#
All your sad and lost apostles
A               E
hum my name and flare their nostrils
F#                                 A      A/Ab/G/F#
Choking on the bones you tossed to them
F#
now I'm not one to sit and spin
         A                 E
because living well's the best revenge
D           A              E
Baby, I am calling you on that

Verse:

B
Don't turn your talking points on me.

History will set me free
                                                        A
The future is ours and you don't even rate a footnote now!
B
So who's chasing you? Where did you go?

You disappear mid-sentence

In a judgement crisis I see my in and go for it
              A
You weakened shill.

Chorus:

F#
All your sad and lost apostles
A                E
hum my name and flare their nostrils
F#                                   A   A/Ab/G/F#
Choking on the bones you tossed to them
F#
now I'm not one to sit and spin
          A                  E
because living well is the best revenge
D                A              E
and baby, I am calling you on that

Verse:

B
You savor your dying breath

I forgive but I don't forget

You work it out, let's hear that argument again
                       A
Camera three... GO NOW!

Chorus:

F#
All your sad and lost apostles
A                 E
hum my name and flare their nostrils
F#                                   A  Ab/G/F#
Choking on the bones you tossed to them
F#
now I'm not one to sit and spin
           A                E
because living well is the best revenge
D                A              E
and baby, I am calling you on that
D              A            E
Baby, I am calling you on that
D              A            E
Baby, I am calling you on that

Lyrics:

It's been pretty simple so far, vacation in Athens is calling me
And knock, knock, knock on wood, I thought I'd left you behind
Heaven is yours, heaven is yours, heaven's yours where I live

The thought of the catacombs left my soul at home
This letter never sent
And it's so far, it's so dark, i'm so lost
Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
  (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
When I'm moving too fast, where's my new address?

The water is evening now, the catacombs are filling in
If my soul was made of stone, no, not, not so dark, dark

And it's so far, it's so dark, i'm so lost
And it's so far, it's so far, it's so far

Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
 (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
 (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)

Staring Down The Barrel of The Middle Distance

Verse:
E   D2 x However many times necessary

Pre-Chorus Chords:
A5   G5   x How ever many times necessary

Chorus Chords:
A5   B5   C5   D5 x2

(All these patterns just happen many times over)

Now the hope for the future took a pounding in the parking lot
And the answer for today is all I got
When your name is called the lights went down
The time is the essence excuse me
And I'm blinking at the vanishing point of what I thought

Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

I greet despair to a standard prayer
If you call for the future I don't care
And I turn you round to face me here
There's a compass raised with a familiar tone
With a voice that needles me to the bone

Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

Whose position shifts cause its been effect
If you can't hit play cause the button sticks
Ignorance is bliss, I can't say
There's a compass raised with familiar tone
With a voice that needles you to the bone
You're left with chaos, static and delay

Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

Staring down the barrel of the middle distance
God knows I've tried
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

"The followers of chaos out of control
They're numbering the monkeys
The monkeys and the monkeys,"

The call came in to Party Central

To liberty and honor under the honor roll

A stampede at the monument
To liberty and honor under the honor roll

Cogs and grunts and hirelings
A meeting of a mean idea to hold

"When feeding time has come and gone

Mr. Richards, your position is a messenger pigeon,
E5                    Emaj7 E5
left behind you when the camp moved on.
E5                    Emaj7 E5              Emaj7
You thought that you had listened but the words had never crystallized,
E5                    Emaj7 E5
into a truth that you might own, hey hey

E5                    Emaj7 E5              Emaj7
Mr. Richards your conviction, had us cheering in the kitchen,
E5                    Emaj7 E5
now the jury's eating pigeon pie,
E5                    Emaj7 E5              Emaj7
So tell me how is prison, have they taught you how to listen?,
E5                    Emaj7 E5
We've begun to bridge the schism, pay attention pay attention,


[Chorus]

Notes:
In the verse it seems that Peter does not hit the high e string but he
strums every chord once and then the stays at the melodic strings til the
next chord.


D5                   Am7
If the storm doesn't kill me
    C                 G
the government will
           D5       Am7       Fill1
I've gotta get that out of my head
       D         Am7         C         G
It's a new day today and the coffee is strong
  D       Am7      Fill11
I finally got some rest

So a man's put to task and challenges
I was taught to hold my head high
Collect what is mine,
Make the best of what today has

D*                     C*      Fill2
Houston is filled with promise
D*                   C*
Laredo's a beautiful place
D*                            C*                Fill2
and Galveston sings like that song that I loved
F                        G
Its meaning has not been erased

And so there are claims forgiven
And so there are things that are gone

Houston is filled with promise
Laredo is a beautiful place
and Galveston sings like that song that I loved
Its meaning has not been erased

F
And some things, they fall to the wayside
G                         D5
Their memory is yet to be stilled
F
Belief has not failed me
    G                        D5
And so I am put to the test

Nature abhors a vacuum but whatâ€™s between your ears?

Your judgement cluttered with fearful thoughts

A headlights and a deer â€“ ow!

On the Fly
You said that loving me was falling off a log
You always had a way with words
I"m in a barrel over Niagra Falls
I wonder if I am defaced
If I asked of you just one wish
Would you turn on me and take the fifth
Your off again on some epic celebration
Shooting barrels full of fish
You found another hole to waltz into
You found another car to crash
I figured if out that if you served me up
Another of this shall pass
Its easy laugh off easy to brush aside
We"re living our lives we"re here on the fly
Its easy laugh off easy to brush aside
We"re living our lives we"re here on the fly
And I just happened by

I stood there naked by the trains again
Frozen stock still in the yard
A Heron waiting for the fish to jump
I never let down my guard
I"ve been exclusive when it comes to you
I don"t receive at all
I wished I felt the same when you called me late
I almost wished you didn"t call
God knows what I"m looking for
And God knows what I am
Cause Even Jesus had his reservations
I won"t be doubting you again
I won"t be doubting you again
Its easy laugh off easy to brush aside
We"re living our lives we"re here on the fly
Its easy laugh off easy to brush aside
We"re living our lives we"re here on the fly
And I just happened by
I"m living my life, I"m here on the fly
And I just happened by

I saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm.
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged.
Bells are ringing through the town again,
Children look up, all they hear is sky-blue, bells ringing

And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"

 Am                    C
Way to seal the hated heat.
 G                     D
Way to put myself to sleep.
 Am                    C
Way to shield the hated heat.
 G                      D/Dsus4
Way to put myself, my children to sleep.

He piloted this song in a plane like that one.
She is selling faith on the Go Tell crusade.
Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again.
Field to weed is lookin' thin

And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We've been on this shift too long."
And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"

"Horse To Water"
B
I could have kept my head down

B
I might have kept my mouth shut

B
I should have held my own,

B
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.


SAME PROGRESSION AGAIN:
You're only as big as your battles.
Rattle my cage with your shadow.
I'm a phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,
Don't you know that what comes around goes around?


Em    B
I'm not that easy,

A5     B
I am not your horse to water.

Em                B   A5
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.

VERSE PROGRESSION AGAIN:

Don't darken my doorstep again,
You're mixing up living in chin-chin,
You're mixing up lose with win-win,
You lead a horse to water and you watch him drown.

You stumble on glass top table,
TV's chewing shock-gone cable
Pump me up a beanstalk fable
And I'll call this entertainment
'cause Humpty's falling down.


CHORUS:
I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.


VERSE
Pick a fight an ultra-buzzy bubble
Friday night fuckin' fried-up pub crawl
Phantom-weight with a mouth full of feathers,
Don't you know that what comes around goes around?


CHORUS
I'm not that easy,
I am not your horse to water.
I hold my breath I come around, round, round.

It's not that easy
I am not your horse to water
I hold my breath, I come around, round, round

ENDING

A-B-A-G
It's going down, down, down

G-A-G-F#
This runaround, round, round

F#-G-F#-F
Is bound to pound

    Em
The daylights out of you!

Iâ€™m Gonna DJ

If death is pretty final, I'm collected vinyl

G   A#-G-A#   C   D

When I spin my way right through it grates enthusiast Jack Pruett

E5                      D5                C
As the moths circle the moon, as you're circling the room
E5
Music will provide the light you cannot resist

D5       C
you cannot resist, you cannot resist
G7
And the weblogs that get tangled as you bully and you wangle
When you walk up in Seattle, where you fought the nascent battle
G7
You threw the thread and throttle let us raise another bottle
Raise another bottle, raise another bottle

Because death is pretty final, I'm collecting vinyl

G   A#-G-A#   C   D
I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world


(SAME CHORD PROGRESSIONS AS MENTIONED ABOVE, BASICALLY)

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady

It's on my mind, it's in my mind

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady

Hey steady steady, hey steady steady
I don't wanna go till I'm good and ready

Music will provide the light you cannot resist
You cannot resist, you cannot resist

Welcome the ugly animal.
I hold my breath to what you sing,
My pyro acrobat ball and chain,
I'm not afraid, I messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up

FEELING GRAVITY'S PULL

  {play the riff but start with the stuff on the 7th fret of
   the low E string}

I fell asleep and read just about every paragraph.

Read the scene where gravity is pulling me around
Peel back the mountains peel back the sky
Stomp gravity into the floor
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it
Time and distance are out of place here

{The riff is like this:
(B) ------0------0------0------0----|
(G) ----0------0------0------0------|
(D) --------------------------------|
(A) -----------------------0--------|

Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
                                        {start the riff again}
When the light is mine, I felt gravity pull

Somewhere near the end it said
"You can't do this", I said "I can too"
Shift sway rivers shift, oceans fall and mountains drift
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it

Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
                                          C           D
When the light is mine, I felt gravity pull onto my eyes,
C            D
holding my head straight (looking down).
 C                              B
This is the easiest task I've ever had to do...

As we've written our stories to entertain

(Verse chords)

Sinking fast, the weight chained to my feet
No time to argue with belief
I'm not alone, a thousand others dropping
Faster than me
What put me here?
Nothing to hold on to
Nowhere to brake

(Chorus Chords)

Where is the ripcord, the trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?
No time to question the choices I make


(END OF CHORUS chords)

I've got to follow another direction (although fall down is much cooler)

(Verse chords)

The last thing I remember was climbing up the stairs
I threw the window open in challenge and despair
I don't know what I needed
I needed time
I needed to escape
I saw the future turn
Upside-down and hesitate.

Accelerate.


(Verse chords)

The vista I see now is changing
Uncertainty is suffocating

Lit up down
A pounding pulse
To make it go
Make it slow down,
Go.

(Chorus Chords)

Where is the ripcord, the trapdoor, the key?
Where is the cartoon escape-hatch for me?
No time to question the choices I make


(END OF CHORUS chords)

I've got to follow another direction.

(Verse chords)

The city's burning, it's like it's ready to explode
Accelerate to make it slow
Make it go
Accelerate to make it slow
Make it go


(END OF CHORUS chords)

I'm incomplete
I'm incomplete
I'm incomplete.

(During the intro and breakdown, Peter sticks to this. During the verse,
however,
he adlibs a bit and instead of hitting the second "7" of the riff, he will
substitute
by hitting the high E string or some other random note.)

She didn't want to get pinned down by her prior town
Get me to the train on time, here take this nickel make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end, I don't know another friend
Another wife, another morning spent
Listen, listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

We never wrote the reasons that I need explained
Some things are givens, and others get away
This time its for myself you call it what you may
Okay, we won't say goodbye so long, so much more
Listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

Listen to the bargain holler
Listen to the barter holler
Listen to the auctioneer

Get me to the train on time here take this nickel make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end, an I don't know another friend
Another wife, another morning spent
Listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine
Another engine, another engine

Do I stand the bargain holler?
Listen to the barter holler

Lyrics:

I can't see myself at thirty, I don't buy a lacquered thirty
Caught like flies, preserved for tomorrow's jewelery, again
Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback
Preserved for tomorrow's eyes, in tree beer tar-black brer sap,
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost

Who will tend the farm museums?  Who will dust today's belongings?
Who will sweep the floors, hedging near the givens?
Rally round your leaders it's the mediator season
Diane is on the beach, do you realize the life she's led?
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, oh man I think we're lost
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
A matter of course, Jefferson, Jeffer

Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback
Sky-lied, sty-tied, Nero pie-tied, in tree tar-black brer sap,
Reason has harnessed the tame, a lodging, not stockader's game
Another Greenville, another Magic Mart, Jeffer, grab your fiddle,
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost

They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off
A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got
Metal shoes on wood push through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "REACT", R-E-A-C-T

Reddened their necks, collared their clothes
Then we danced the dance till the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

She said...

Tuning: DADGBE (that's dropped D)
[Note: The solo guitar line is marked as being tuned EADGBE.  It's a different
guitar.  It doesn't really matter, however: since the solo line doesn't go
down to the 6th string, you can play both parts on the same guitar without
trouble.]

She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
She's got pretty persuasion

It's what I want, hurry and buy,
all has been tried, follow reasoning,
And I put that in this heat it's all wrong
Try to wear that on my sleeve it's all wrong all wrong

He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
He's got pretty persuasion

In the line of heart,
All is peeling away,

It's what I want, hurry and buy,
all has been tried, follow reason and buy,
Try to put that in this heat it's all wrong
Cannot wear that on your sleeve it's all wrong it's all wrong

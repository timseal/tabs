Em
       Am
As the sun comes up, as the moon goes down
       F
these heavy notions creep around
    Am
it makes me think
      F         Am
long ago I was brought into
this life a little lamb
   F
a little lamb
             Am
courageous, stumbling
                 F
fearless was my middle name
                        D
but somewhere there I lost my name
           C
everyone walks the same
          D
expecting me to step
            C
the narrow path they've laid
they claim to
 Em       G
walk unafraid
         Em        G
I'll be clumsy instead
         Em          G       D
hold my love me or leave me high

(same chords again)

Say "keep within the boundaries if you want to play"
Say "contradiction only makes it harder"
how can I be
what I want to be?
when all I want to do is strip away
these stilled constraints
and crush this charade
shred this sad masquerade
I don't need no persuading
I'll trip, fall, pick myself up and
walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
hold my love me or leave me high

If I have a bag of rocks to carry as I go
I just want to hold my head up high
I don't care what I have to step over
I'm prepared to look you in the eye
look me in the eye
and if you see familiarity
then celebrate the contradiction
help me when I fall to
walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
hold my love me or leave me high
walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead
hold my love me or leave me high

then celebrate the contradiction
help me when I fall to
walk unafraid

walk unafraid
I'll be clumsy instead

WALK UNAFRAID

tabbed by miKe. (ericseis@hotmail.com)

(N.B. ~~~ = hold note using e-bow.)

Intro:
First just tap and scratch around on the fifteenth(ish) fret, then

a|-------------------------------------------
E|--5~6~~/11~10~~~~/5~6~~~/11~10~~/15~~~~

(this is all played on the bottom string with an e-bow, but lots of 
distortion should do the trick just as well.)


Verses:
The chords aren't actually played. In the verses, instead Peter 
just uses an e-bow and plays the root notes, i.e.

   (A)   (F)   (A)   (F)        for the Am F   
E|--5~~~~/1~~~~/5~~~~/1~~~~--   progression     
  and
    (D)   (C)    (D)   (C)      for the D C
E|--10~~~~/8~~~~/10~~~~/8~~~~-- progression

Peter doesn't this all the time during the verses, sometimes he'll just kinda'
slide up and down a string, making eerie noises, while the bass just thumps out:

   (A)              (F)                (A)
E|--5---5---5-5--5---/1---1---1-1---1---/5-   and so on.


Chorus:
The Em - G - D chords are played as normal in the chorus.

And the intro riff twice to end.

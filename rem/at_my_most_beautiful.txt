At my most beatiful - R.E.M.

One of the many great songs from the new album, I just picked it out, believe it's correct. The bass notes on F/A and Bb/F sound a lot better if played on a real bass and/or a piano, but if you only have a guitar, I guess that's better then nothing...

Lyrics:

I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
a way to make you smile

I read bad poetry
into your machine
I save your messages
just to hear your voice.
you always listen carefully
to awkwards rhymes.
you always say your name.
like I woulden't know it's you,
at your most beautiful.

I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
a way to make you smile

at my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes secretly.
with every one, whisper I love you.
I let you sleep.
I know you're closed eye watching me,
listening.
I thought I saw a smile.

I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
a way to make you smile

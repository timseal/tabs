You said the air was singing
Am///        C///                     Am///

These things you've never seen

Verse 3
Good morning.  How are you
The weather's fine
The sky is blue
It's perfect for a seminar
Close your eyes and start to breathe
Allow yours eyes to recede
Allow yourself to drift and fly away
And you just stay

Chorus 1

you?

Verse 4
Locked into. The conference room
We're only what. our minds assume
And rational is leaving you
This concieved these systems
I believe your counsellor agrees
You always walked these boundaries
Now you're free
To make believe

Once you had a dream of oceans, sunken cities memories
Of things you've never known
You have never known

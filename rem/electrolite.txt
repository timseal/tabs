G                      Cadd9             G
Your eyes are burning holes through me.
Cadd9     G
I'm gasoline.          
Cadd9          G       Cadd9    
I'm burnin' clean.

G              Cadd9            G
Twentieth Century go to sleep
Cadd9          G
You're plasticine.
Cadd9          G
That is obscene.
Cadd9          D
That is obscene.

     Am             D
You are the star tonight.
      Am               D
Your sun electric, outta sight.
                  B                                Em     G
Your light eclipsed the moon tonight.
   Am     Em     G      Am Em   G   D
Elecrolite. You're outa sight.

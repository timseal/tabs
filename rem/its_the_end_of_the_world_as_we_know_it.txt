IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT (AND I FEEL FINE)

(lyrics from official lyric sheet)


G                               Cmaj7
That's great, it starts with an earthquake, 
                     G                         Cmaj7
birds and snakes, an aeroplane - Lenny Bruce is not afraid.  
G
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
Cmaj7
world serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs.  
G
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt no, strength no.  
Cmaj7
Ladder structure clatter with fear of height, down height.  
Bb
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
     Am
in a government for hire and a combat site.


G                                                              Cmaj7
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies breathing down your neck. 
G                       
Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop.  
             Cmaj7
Look at that low plane!  Fine then.  
G                                               Cmaj7
Uh oh, overflow, population, common group, but it'll do.  

Save yourself, serve yourself.  
                 G
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed.  
                 Cmaj7
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right - right.  
    Bb                                               Am
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light, feeling pretty psyched.


         G         Dsus2    Am
It's the end of the world as we know it 
         G         Dsus2     Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
         G         Dsus2     Am                         C
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine


G
Six o'clock - TV hour.  Don't get caught in foreign tower.  
      Cmaj7
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn.  
G
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting.  
      Cmaj7
Every motive escalate.  Automotive incinerate.  
G
Light a candle, light a motive.  Step down, step down.  
         Cmaj7
Watch a heel crush, crush.  
                  G
Uh oh, this means no fear - cavalier.  Renegade and steer clear!
Cmaj7
   A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies.  
Bb                                             Am
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline.
 

         G         Dsus2    Am
It's the end of the world as we know it 
         G         Dsus2     Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
         G         Dsus2     Am                         C   Cmaj7
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine
G         Cmaj7     G    Cmaj7      G    F
    I feel fine

         G         Dsus2    Am
It's the end of the world as we know it 
         G         Dsus2     Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
         G         Dsus2     Am                         C 
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine


G 
The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide.
      Cmaj7
Mount St. Edelite.  Leonard Bernstein.  
G  
Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs.
Cmaj7
   Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!  
    Bb                                    Am
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam, but neck, right?  Right.

 
         G         Dsus2    Am
It's the end of the world as we know it 
         G         Dsus2     Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
         G         Dsus2     Am                         C
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine

         G         Dsus2    Am
It's the end of the world as we know it 
         G         Dsus2     Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
         G         Dsus2     Am                         C
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine

         G         Dsus2    Am
It's the end of the world as we know it 
         G         Dsus2     Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
         G         Dsus2     Am                         C
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine

It's the end of the world as we know it 
         G         Dsus2     Am

It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine
